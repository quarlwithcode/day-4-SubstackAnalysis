TRANSCRIPT
========================================

This is an example transcript file showing the format that will be used for all downloaded YouTube transcripts. When you download a real transcript using the app, it will be saved in this format with the actual video content.

The transcript will contain the full text from the YouTube video, which can then be used for neuropsychological analysis of the influencer's language patterns, key phrases, and communication style.

Each file is named using the pattern: [influencer-name]-[video-title].txt

This makes it easy to organize and find specific transcripts for analysis.
