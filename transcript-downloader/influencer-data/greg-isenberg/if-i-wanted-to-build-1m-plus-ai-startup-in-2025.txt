========================================

Cal aai is really cool like I downloaded that app and it's amazing but there's going to be like a hundred of them in the App Store in like two months and then Cal will not be able to charge what they are and I just go like those are good oneoff bites those are good for going from a college dorm to being a millionaire but they're not going to get you to a decamillionaire I think like your Equity value is just toast within a very short period of time because I just think the pricing ultimately goes to zero what do you see as like a business that you can Implement AI or build an agent that can still be highly competitive and successful in two or three years if you want to build an AI business you need either a data advantage or a network effect Advantage it's never been easier to build a million-dollar business and it's never been easier to lose all your Equity value so I just think that's a hard world to be a business person and it's exciting it's the most excited I've ever been for business because it's easier than ever to start a business but the worst businesses are the ones that are easy to [Music] start good to see you good to see you too man so today I was thinking we can talk about uh where are you seeing the opportunities right now with AI because in my mind I you know I know you look up to the Charlie mongers and War buffets of the world value investing you know Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger value investing you know what does that mean it means like seeing a rough in the diamonds and and sort of seeing opportunity and I'm curious where are you seeing opportunity in this world of AI agents and and AI in general I think the hard part is that um in a lot of instances it's like a sustaining Innovation right and what I mean by that is it's a new technology that will drop the cost so let's say that you're um you know we were just talking about recruiting businesses so let's say um you know you start a online recruiting business or you buy an online recruiting business and they have a 20 person outbound email team so you know you might think you're a genius because you're like oh I'll get a you know an outbound recruiter agent that will just replace all those people and now my margins will be way higher but what actually happens is maybe for 6 months you get that Arbitrage but all of your competitors have the same realization within 6 12 months months and then the price drops and you're in the same business and maybe it's even more competitive than before so I think um it's one of the most interesting times to be an investor and entrepreneur because you know we've always been building sand castles on the beach in Tech like I think we all knew um you know anyone can compete you know you start a to-do list software business and anyone at any time can launch a competitor it's just that before there was a finite number of coders in the world uh there was only so much Venture Capital money out there and there was just less competition I think now you get far more competition in Far More niches um and I think Moes matter more than ever you know where you know a mo before might have been um you know I make funeral home management software and the moat is that it's too small of a market for Venture Capital to play in and none of the other people that own funeral homes know how to code but that's not not a mode anymore what a real mode would be is I have software that allows um funeral homes to keep track of all their inventory and trade it back and forth or buy it and then you have a network effect now someone can't just go Vibe code that in a weekend because now you have a network effect so um you know I think social networks are really interesting I think communities are really interesting but I think most tools have become a 100 times harder yeah I mean I I totally agree I think uh I just want to I want to get more tactical I'm trying to think like what okay I think everyone agrees honestly I think everyone agrees that I mean I can't tell you how many distribution is the new moat tweet I've seen in the last like three weeks it's like everyone has finally agreed that distribution is the new Mo that anyone could create anything the latest thing is by the way that Vibe coding is really don't Vibe code your way to production code that's like the latest meme that's going around cuz I don't know if you saw there was this like viral post that this guy was using cursor and he ended up posting it uh production code and then he got hacked and bad things could happen um so I agree with all those things and I think 99% of people listening to this agree so what's our next step like I actually want to treat this as like you know and we've done this before I've just you know you've called me I've called you and been like okay so what do we do here so I've got I mean I've got a bunch of ideas I wrote down a bunch of ideas for things people could build as as we usually do the problem you know as I look at it is almost all of them can be competed Away really really quickly so I think it's been it's never been easier to build a million-dollar business and it's never been easier to lose all your Equity value right so I think it's going to be really easy to have gold rush uh you know oh hey like Peter levels can launch this flight imator and make a million dollar but is that a sustainable business in two years when there's a thousand of these flight simulators to be honest I don't know what the opportunity is um I think it's a bit of a sad answer like I I'm not seeing a lot of opportunities to go and buy or start businesses um where I think there's a sustainable competitive Advantage I think there's a cost Advantage there's a Time Advantage but I'm not I mean I would be really curious to put that back to you like what do you see as like a business that you can Implement AI or build an agent that can still be highly competitive and successful in two or three years because I'm increasingly of the mind that for all tools um basically all middlemen businesses are gone and I believe fundamentally that we are all going to go to the search bar and the new search bar is chat gbt and you're going to query it and chat gbt will just build whatever you need or it'll hook into whatever apis you need and so the only things that really matter at this point now are um you know real world goods and services uh compute or network effects of some kind I I don't like that answer what what have you got like I'd love to hear your answer to this I mean my take is if you want to build an AI business you need either a data advantage or a network effect Advantage so um I think what does that mean for us it means that we probably shouldn't be buying or incubating AI businesses today so quick break in the Pod to tell you a little bit about startup Empire so startup Empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people like me like you who want to build out their startup ideas now they're looking for content to help accelerate that they're looking for potential co-founders they're looking for uh tutorials from people like me to come in and tell them how do you do email marketing how do you build an audience how do you go viral on Twitter all these different things that's exactly what startup Empire is and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but just they're not seeing the traction uh that they need so you can check out the link to Startup empire.co in the description I think the advant I think what I what I'm interested in doing frankly and and I'm giving my playbook here but it's it's basically like I would I would either want to buy media businesses or incubate media businesses why because I think that if you assume that you can Vibe code software and you can create the most beautiful to-do list app I saw someone uh Vibe code their way to things three a clone of things 3 which is something that I've used for for many years now in minutes and it like actually works and it's beautiful so if you can assume that okay you can Vibe code things three which for me was like an aha moment around like beautiful software to-do list app then okay the opportunities in either buying media businesses incubating media businesses and then once you've built that Network effect then you can start saying like Okay now how do I get these people's data that's your next step your first step is how do I get your the attention next step is how do I get your data and then the third step is okay how can I build assistance co-pilots AI software to actually monetize and build a sustainable business so what would be the sort of media business that you would want to buy because I maybe I have a different take but I want to hear what you're imagining like what let's say you could press a button and buy magically buy the company of your choice what company would it be well I'll tell you like my framework for thinking about what would be a good company to buy so I want it to be a high value Niche like I wouldn't want it to be you know I don't en I I envy Mr Beast in a lot of ways but on on on the other hand I don't envy Mr Beast like he's got billions of people looking at him but they're they're low value I'm just talking purely economical like I want a he's got to sell stuff to kids and kids don't have money exactly um but I'll I'll I'll give one I I'll give two two businesses that I think would be interesting to buy that are high value that are probably under monetized one is Tech runch which just has a great brand name to you and I like we have so many memories from you know the Silicon Valley early Silicon Valley days like launching on Tech runch that sort of thing where I think it was bought by AOL uh right yeah I think so Michael Arrington was the guy who started it and then he sold in like what 2008 or something exactly so I bet you there's a deal to be had where they're probably struggling they're trying to probably figure out who they are what they are um but they've got a high value value Niche with a great brand so I would buy something like Tech runch the other kind of the other interesting thing to buy would be a very sought-after event series so my dream you ask who my dream company would to buy would be like if I can buy South by Southwest you know Ted is for sale right now maybe you should buy that I didn't know is is that is that for real yeah it's for it's for real I think it's public knowledge right now they're shopping it around and he's gonna give it I think he's gonna give it away to whoever is going to be the best new owner of it so maybe you should go pitch Chris Chris Anderson yeah I mean I think uh I think Ted has done an incredible job of turning an event series into a media company but they've stopped that Media company so I think this is a perfect like Ted would be incredible around like okay all these people who watch Ted Ted videos ideas worth spreading how do you give them not just ideas but also tools and what are those tools and how could you VI Vibe code your so just just so I understand so let's say you buy um a yachting website and it has a big community of people that are all into yachting and they just read the news on there and you're basically saying you could Vibe code a bunch of cool data tools so for example what are people paying for their yachts and how much are they paying to maintain them and then once you have that data you can sell them services and all that kind of stuff exactly yeah I think that's that's really smart it one I mean we've looked at a lot of um different media Brands and you know buying these kind of distressed assets and stuff and we've always passed because it feels like um it feels like like do you you think about like what's happened to like Forbes now it's like do you remember like seeing friends post on Forbes you be like whoa like that's crazy they're on Forbes and then you realize like forbs basically just opened it up to anybody and any SEO person could just post on Forbes and it just kind of died like I'm really curious like I love Kevin Rose but like relaunching dig I'm like so curious about that like does that actually work and is that Nostalgia worth something um and I I I'm fully with you in terms of like taking a community that is monetized in the wrong way and just monetizing it in the right way um do you think that's a unique AI related thing though because I think that was an opportunity five years ago and it's still will be now it'll just be a little easier to build it'll be easier and cheaper to build the tools to sell them yeah I think uh it was an opportunity back then two years ago three years ago but I think that it's a it's not a little bit easier to build it's it's significantly easier to build and also maybe even more importantly there's demand from consumers to try new apps for example the one the the flavor right now is Cal you know apps like that like those those companies are doing like $20 million ARR on on downloading an app and you know how hard it is to download apps and getting someone to to to to download an app so I think that uh what AI has done also has just made it um it's it's it's created new use cases it's created you know with C for example you take a picture and it tells you using llms how many calories it is that's cool you couldn't do that a few years ago you know it's interesting um I got to have dinner with Charlie Munger like for the first time like six years ago and you know he's like at the time he was like 97 and we would we would be talking about all these different ideas for Investments and stuff and he would always just say like it's hard investing is hard and I was kind of like you know it was like a 2018 or whatever like I was at my peak in terms of like you know no one else was doing what we're doing we're just like on a buying frenzy we're you know valuations are great and I was like what is this old guy talking about like and what I realized in retrospect is is that he you know he just got such a big scale and such a competitive part of the market where you know you're buying businesses for 10 billion dollars to move the needle that it just becomes inherently competitive and I think that is happening in in all arenas right now and I think I kind of am becoming I'm slowly becoming the Crusty old man at the table where you know think about like all the things that were kind of easy to start before like you know newsletters and all that kind of stuff I just think there will be almost unlimited competition in all these Arenas um whether it's apps like right now like the example is like Cal AI is really cool like I downloaded that app and it's amazing uh and there's tons of those but there's going to be like a hundred of them in the App Store in like two months and then Cal will not be able to charge what they are and I just go like those are good oneoff bites those are good for going from a college dorm to being a millionaire but they're not going to get you to a decamillionaire I think like your Equity value is just toast within a very short period of time because I just think the pricing ultimately goes to zero um and I think all as well for like newsletters and attention in general like I recently I own like a a local newsletter business and I was goofing around with Lindy and I was able in about an hour to build a a Lindy agent that could go through um it would basically like choose a I I chose a city um like a city near me and I said every day I want you to uh there's three different agents one sources all the news and it goes through like local Reddit like forums local news websites or whatever and then uh another one that like takes it all and writes it and punches it up and makes it like fun and cool or whatever and then the other one that formats it as a newsletter and it is perfect it is better than any local news letter that I could write and it's more detailed because it goes to all these different sources and it even fact checks itself so I just think it's going to become crazy I it's going to I think all of our inboxes are going to get overloaded with great content that's written by Ai and I think a lot of these businesses are just going to get so freaking hard like what the other thing that's interesting is like when you talk about data like I find that whole thing really interesting because I think data and a network effect are kind of interl where um you know I was talking to someone at um at one of the frontier models I won't say who but I was like um oh you know we own all these social networks or whatever and they have all this interesting proprietary data and he was like oh yeah we probably ate all that like you know they just they've gobbled up the entire internet and like yeah you can go and like sue them but like even a data you know it's not like a data Moe because now all your data probably exists within an llm already right like I it's hard to identify like what is actually unique data because all they need to do is gobble up a big enough sample size to have it be predictable in almost any Arena I mean okay let's talk about I want to talk about a few things because you talked about a lot of things here so the CI example if I was CI what I would have tried to so I would have acknowledged the fact that they're going to get a thousand competitors and I would have said okay how do I create a network effect in this app it doesn't look like they're doing that I I don't know but it doesn't look like they're doing that so all the people that have downloaded Cal are people interested in health and tracking their health healthy lifestyle and maybe they want to lose weight so does the modern Weight Watchers which was a multi-billion dollar company that like Oprah was a part of um does the modern Weight Weight Watchers start looking like a cal ey in 2025 probably but they had to build the network effects to go there but Weight Watchers started as a physical Moe because you'd go to a meet up in your town and then you'd have all this social buyin and you have people that are in your network selling you right I think Cal or these these guys just like I just don't know what my advice would be like if that guy came to me I'd probably be like just sell like find someone who doesn't understand Ai and just like sell it and be like look like the AR keeps going up you should buy this for $5 million and and ghetto because uh personally like I tried Cal but I also think I tried like two or three others and I think I ultimately found a tool that was just cheaper and like maybe I'm just a cheap bastard but like I think they basically get bifurcated into um you know there's all these like AI photo editors um on iPhone and they're just for suckers right like it's literally like do a 7-Day free trial and then it's like $49 every two weeks and you're suddenly spending like $1,500 a year for like a basic AI photo editor there's those guys and they're like borderline criminal like I find that like crazy um and then there's people that'll just create these things for free or a dollar and and then ultimately Apple will just eat them and this is this is the thing is like the largest the at the end of the day like the people that will ultimately capture a lot of this value are going to be whoever controls the devices because I do believe like a lot of these llm um a lot of this functionality will Ely be implemented so I think like if you can find a niche like let's talk about two different things so one is um buying a business or starting a business that is a five or a 10 year business and then separately we can talk about how to make your first million bucks because I think like there's nothing wrong with making your first million bucks and building a Vibe coded crappy app and and then it disappearing into years that's awesome that's a great win but for guys like you and me like it's got to be something that is sustainable um yeah why don't we talk about should we should we dig into a couple ideas and stuff first of all before we dig into that I'm just curious we should talk about like what kind of automations and tools we're using uh I'd love to hear what you're doing right now um so right now like currently I'm spending a lot of time with gum Loop have you have you played with gum loop at all so gum Loop if understand it's similar to like make or Lindy yeah exactly it it's very similar and by the way like I don't it's not like I'm recommending one platform or another platform like my my Mo right now is just to get smart on all the platforms and I'm starting to notice that there's something I like more in Lindy and there's something I like more of gum Loop like there's something I hate about gum Loop that Lindy or someone else does better so my recommendation honestly is just to try them all and see what you like and you don't like um but I'm uh you know my company has been running on zapier for the last four you know four years and zapier has been really good to us and and when I found zapier it was a GameChanger honestly for our business we were just automating so much stuff that uh we had human beings do so for example um sales leads like we would have someone go in every day look into our sales CRM and basically report back who are these leads is this a good lead is this a bad lead and then create reports um with zapier which was really cool we created a slack Channel and every lead basically gets scored and gets put into the slack Channel and the whole team gets to see uh the sales lead so it's to me I'm looking at that as like you know co-owner of the business I'm like this is amazing but the the problem was the there really wasn't much intelligence meaning uh it was more of like the scoring wasn't very good basically it's Boolean like if this then that if it doesn't match perfectly it's messed up it's messed up so what it basically did was it just posted it to a slack Channel um with gum Loop now we can actually go and say like okay this sales lead came in Andrew wi Andrew tiny.com um who is Tiny uh what time did he uh come in was this at two in the morning maybe people at two in the morning actually want our services way more maybe we can charge them more because he came in at two in the morning um what is the size of tiny um how many companies do they own what is the revenue how many employees um and it and just add intelligence in that in that process so from a sales perspective doing that with gum Loop has been pretty fun and do you guys do um so let's say a lead comes in do you have an AI agent like email them back and say like hey can you tell me more about your company and stuff exactly that's cool that's really cool yeah but only if it's not maybe a let's say we would score you as a 10 on 10 lead someone like you actually might not want an agent to reach out to you you might actually a fake person and it's got to be delayed a certain amount of time I know but I also think that uh you know people are saying that agents are going to automate 20 everything 247 um there's some things that the human touch is going to be better right like me recording a vid if you if you you know signed up to one of our forms maybe me actually recording a video and being like hey this is Greg you know we have a common friend in Shan pory um I'd love to talk to you about our service that probably would be better at this stage with a human in the loop in my opinion totally but I do I do believe like pretty soon Greg can be an agent and just be a video that looks like you yeah yeah I agree so I've been messing around with that that's top of mine right now and then the other thing that's top of mine and I want to hear what you you've been up to is just Manis aai playing with Manis AI it's crazy it's so cool I just I my um I I literally was I always have this problem where I get excited about a a project and then I go on Twitter and I'm like hey I need someone to run this thing or I'm hiring for this role and then I get like 50 emails and so I did that recently with a project which I'll talk about later and I got so many applicants and I just dread it because I just I hate going through all the applicants and if I hand it off to my assistant like she kind of she's busy with other stuff and like she doesn't really know what to look for or whatever and so I took all those emails I exported them out of Gmail as a zip and I uploaded 50 candidates to Manis and then it just spent 30 minutes scoring them all based on what I needed and it was like these are the best three people and then I just focused on those people and it was totally bang on so cool yeah I mean and it's unbiased too right even if it I'm not saying your bias but everyone has some biases to any of their decisions subconscious um or not so I think that that's also really cool is I mean I guess you can say the llms have biases too though they have human I guess they have human bias because they're trained on our data exactly so yeah I'll tell you kind of like a sampling of the things I'm doing like one of the dumbest automations I built recently but I find so satisfying is I have a Lindy agent that looks at my calendar events when I create them and it adds an emoji which is so simple but now my calendar looks really beautiful um more impressive than that I built a Lindy agent that kind of does what you're talking about so it ingests every single email that I get and then it labels it or archives it um based on context and I have all these examples of like different kinds of emails and whatever and then if it's something that I'm likely to say to it'll actually draft the no email for me and I've tried like superum and Sara and a bunch of these other ones but I ultimately wanted to roll my own and just have it just know exactly how it worked um and that's been amazing um the other tool I've been using a lot is versel vzer if you messed with that dude crazy like I I own a um a pressure washing business locally and it's like you know I run it with some kid locally like it's just for for like kind of like a hobby project or whatever um I just don't have time to like dig in and make the website better but they did this like version him and a guy that worked for me did this version of the website which is like it's fine but it could just be so much better and I just threw into into vzer and in like 30 seconds it had completely punched up the website and we had code for it like to me that is just so mindboggling that is something I previously would have spent like a month honestly maybe doing um so that that's been really cool but the thing I really want to talk about and go deep on in this episode is mCP um I think it's so [ __ ] cool um I've been uh implementing a bunch of that stuff Uh custom and I actually think that might be like a my first million kind of opportunity for somebody um to really do mCP right uh and I'm curious are you using mCP for anything right now I I haven't no I'm not I am not there yet so um yeah why don't we dive in I've got I've got a bunch of ideas and stuff but the first one is um so mCP stands for model what is it model context protocol and basically it's a it's a way of piping in data or apis into an llm so the llm can basically query your data set and so um I had this like total breakthrough with Claude maybe like three months ago um one of the things I love about a is it's like I find it's like a bicycle for productivity like I just get so much more done and one of the main reasons I get more done is because I don't have to ask questions of other people so one of the things that would often happen to me would be um you know it's it's a Sunday I'm working um and I I want to know um hey what's happening in this business with our margin or how much are we spending on slack or you know just these random questions and those would be things that unless I really wanted to get fiddly and dive into a bunch of accounting or whatever I would just email to somebody I would lose interest in that problem let's say like I was cost cutting or something like that I'd lose interest in the problem because I have to wait four days for the answer and then I'd find out on Thursday um what I what I did is I went to Claude And I said hey um what information would you need from zero to be able to give me like a full financial analysis on my business and so it gave me a list and you know took like 20 minutes but I went and I exported all the um you know CSV files out of zero I trained a cloud project and it was basically on my accounting for all my personal holding company and my personal life for the last two years and it was magic like just absolute magic like at one point I said um How Could You optimize my taxes and it said oh you have a credit line over here and you have a credit line in your company if you use the um company money to pay down the personal credit line you can just immediately write off like it's like I think it was $100,000 of tax savings or something so that to me that was like oh my God this is Magic um and when I learned about mCP I saw that as an opportunity to try and get live data because the annoying thing about the cloud project is it's all historical data and it's all got to be manually updated and so I hired a developer to work with me literally like came to my house and went on my computer and set it all up or whatever but we got it working and it's really cool so now I can say um it's linked to all my all the companies that use certain like QuickBooks or zero or whatever and I can query and I can say something like um you know across all my companies what's happening with revenue or how much are we spending on this thing or whatever query it is and it can make graphs and charts and tables and stuff um and it's not perfect like I'd say like sometimes the numbers are wrong but it's a breakthrough and so the opportunity I think here is to make the easy kind of oneclick way to do this so an mCP server for the Mac um where you can basically say I want to integrate all these apis and then it just manages downloading the databases onto your computer it manages the interface with Claud and I know there's a few people that have kind of tried to do this but I don't think anyone's really done it properly and and a service business around it like I might not want right like I might not want to hire developer to do this myself and sort of figure it out but if someone could go and probably honestly charging monthly you probably can get away with charging monthly for something like this well the best way to do it would be to be the competitive Advantage would be it's all about security so you're the most secure you're the default like think about like one password is not hard like anyone can Vibe code one password what matters about one password is everybody knows one password has not been compromised and they trust and that's why they pay you know I think we pay 200 bucks a month or whatever to use that software so um I think that's a huge opportunity if someone can actually do it properly and it might be a good one-year business it could also be a good five-year business if executed well I'll give away the name for this business so I would branded ascp.com so think of it think about because mCP is a protocol just like HT HTTP um but you know you also have HTT CPS I think the S stands for secure so if you could basically own I'm the secure mCP guy everywhere else is not secure and create that positioning dichotomy I think that that itself is like going to help you win deals and I think if uh you want to own that domain you got to buy it off Greg for $20,000 because I assume he just bought it no I I do this on the p a lot where I give away domains and then within the first like five minutes of posting someone Snipes it I don't know how you you do this you people but I don't even care like I just I want someone to go and do this build it and and pay it back somehow I like that I really like that idea if anyone wants to do that we should uh we should back them not not that they need not that they need our money yeah but you know it could be it could be fun it could be fun to to be involved so to your earlier point we have distribution so we actually bringue to the table exactly we're not just we're not just cranky old guys we we we we do bring distribution okay so that that's a really good idea also I was thinking about what you were saying about your pressure washer business and I've got another idea for someone to steal that I think is a simple how to make your first million so I think that uh what what people should be doing is be using someone should create essentially an automated agency built on top of vzer that scrapes local businesses and prioritizes the ones that have ugly websites uh train it on like modern design practices minimalists uh you know make them beautiful build the websites and then automatically reaches out to these small business owners and be like hey I just redid your website I love that click here to buy click here to buy and I'll host it and then it's just 20 bucks a month to host it and then any changes you want are $10 every change exactly that and we have your credit card on file they're happy because they've got this be they think they're getting a steal right they're like oh my God $500 for this website and it's already done and they're GNA host it for me this is incredible that the bar is so low like it's crazy the services businesses I mean there's people making a fortune and they have these terrible websites and they barely do SEO and stuff and I think there's a big opportunity just to take best practices and roll them out in that Arena I love that though as a first business I think that's an incredible idea and it might actually be a good long-term business at least for a while yeah have you looked into web hosting businesses ever they're I mean they're phenomenal they're just like people it's like an accounting uh accounting firm it's like people just don't want to switch web hosts that often it's like look at GoDaddy like GoDaddy is the perfect Testament to why it's a good business you can have that horrible user experience in that fugly website and still be like a billion dollar company totally side note I was telling my wife I was like how do you you know how you know someone's in older than 30 is if they want to register a domain and they go to GoDaddy 100% And they or like you email them and you go to their website and it's like this this domain is parked by GoDaddy yeah exactly so okay I got another idea here um this one is like kind of Half Baked but I think it's kind of interesting so um I was dealing with a difficult person via text message and I was like man like I really want help with this like I want help and and sometimes I'll like take an email thread and I'll paste it into Claud and get feedback or whatever but I I started thinking I was like I really wish that I had a way to analyze all my text messages and somebody somebody posted publicly and said you know with these 2 milli context Windows you can now um digest five years worth of text threads and so my idea so like basically like um you know this whole like looks maxing Trend so like basically like it's these apps where you can like take a photo of yourself and it'll like basically hotter not you it'll be like oh you know you your skin is kind of bad and your hairlines receding and like here's all the things you can do and then you keep taking photos to look better and so my idea is message maxing so so on on your Mac and this is just for Mac I don't know how this would work on PC but on your Mac iMessage syncs to a database called I think it's called chats. DB or something like that and it's a big huge 2 gigabyte uh sqlite database my idea is you basically have something to ingest that database and analyze it and it might be with a local llm because it might be too much of a pain in the ass to upload it um and it basically um tells you it could tell you a bunch of different things but one example would be it could tell you which of your friends or contacts is exhibiting toxic narcissistic or Psychopathic traits like who should you steer clear of who's being manipulative um another one might be like how are you exhibiting negative behaviors yourself or how are you being kind of like beta or weak in dating and interactions or that sort of thing um and then also like which friends are you neglecting who should you catch up with and I think like some of these things Apple will do over time like I think their message summaries is like an indication that eventually they're going to start digesting more of your messages but I don't think that Apple would ever tell you who's toxic or narcissistic or whatever and I just think this is the sort of thing that could go very very viral I think this is a one-year business I think this is easy to copy I think someone will copy this idea when I share it they'll make a million dollars it's not a long-term business but it's a cool idea yeah I so I started thinking about businesses like this where I I I start with the Tik Tok because you can imagine what the Tik Tok is going to be right like a viral Tik Tok am I a narcissist showing the screen oh my God you know my boyfriend's a narcissist like you know it's going to work it's just a matter of figuring out the right format so I think that I call these businesses format businesses so it's it's a game of figuring out the format I agree with you that you know it might only last a short amount of time but um it probably falls into the c c well I think it's um I think it so I think and this kind of feeds into my other idea so the other and I think what we said before of like if it's highly highly secure then it can be a high quality business right so if you think about other applications so those are kind of the fun genen Z ideas right of like oh who's a narcist whatever but I think this would be useful for me in terms of business I think it could be helpful of like who are you who are you messaging that you're turning off without realizing it or who's being passive aggressive because I do a lot of business over text messages right having someone coach me on how to write more effective text messages is just like how I'm using Ai and emails so like when I write emails I'm like a you know I'll write back an email that just says like sounds good and some people will view that as passive aggressive but if I add a happy face then it's great or if I write hey Greg sounds good thanks Andrew right and so I just think something that can like tweak what all of your interactions in a positive way I think could be really cool but yeah it's not like a great longterm one it's kind of this idea is kind of like grammarly but more for like social relationships well just think about what data is in there like I think messages are so much more intimate than even email and what I'm craving like I don't know that Google will do this um and this is another idea I have is like an llm that actually ingests not only your messages but your email and then can actually tell you like what's going on in your life so like when I go to chat GPT like you can say something there's a cool prompt that's like going around on Tik Tok that's like based on what you know about me tell me what um tell me what psychological insights you can tell me right and so I did it and it was like oh you're you're a Searcher you're always searching for the next thing or you know whatever it is and it's got all these like different insights and they're kind of like it's almost like horoscopes but they're kind of real right I actually really I did this thing recently where I told Lindy to look at my last 250 emails I had sent and then say uh what projects am I working on and what's the status of each and it was pretty crazy how well it was able to summarize everything that I'm working on based on my email and so I think that um I don't know who's going to do it but I think whoever does that will do very very well and I think it's probably Google but apparently the processing required to do it is quite difficult so the idea the the like startup idea there would be to build um so what I did is I used Lindy and so Lindy sends it to an llm and reads every email some people are very concerned about security they don't want to do that I think in the same way this like secure um mCP idea someone could build a secure local email processor that ingests all your emails tells you what's going on and labels them and does all that on device yeah I think and and that's why I actually think this could be a bigger business like you you can EV you can actually create a secure holding company you know you only work on secure products and agencies and service businesses around you know AI meets SEC sec security um probably do pretty well okay um okay my last idea so have you ever got a loan from A bank yeah so like it takes [ __ ] forever like whether it's bank or private credit or any of these people it's like you know just to get a call is a week and then it's another two months of like hey can you give us this document or that document and then all they do is they just like package it up and they send it to like some wonk at head office who like reviews it all and that is basically an llm right so my idea is AI based lending and the idea would be like you choose a vertical so you'd say like um I want to lend to you know SAS companies or whatever it is and it's just like hey how much do you want and then it starts asking questions and it might say oh do you use stripe okay link us to your stripe API hey upload your ID upload your Articles of Incorporation and it basically just automates all the diligence and packages it up and then at the end you still have a human who goes and verifies that you know there's nothing sketchy or whatever it is but to me this seems like a very obvious idea and it may already exist but I just haven't yet seen that like if I could go and get a $5 million Loan in 48 hours for like buying a business that would be incredible and I don't know why that's not possible other than the fact that it's this very Antiquated industry okay I have a an idea similar to this I want to share so did you see at shl sahill linia tweeted uh I want to give $100,000 to any Vibe coders that will give me 10% profit in exchange for that did you see this no h when viral thought it was really interesting so here's the idea a little mix of sahil's idea and your idea it's the bank of V coding.com and it's it's basically this it's an AI L lending llm where you take a percentage of of course you you know you're not going to accept everyone right but you there's criteria in the llm that says like okay you know who who are you know have you maybe launched successful projects in in the past have you uh do you have more than 10,000 followers on x um is the project are the projects that you're going to work on have stripe integration of course you need that um so and then you just take a percentage of profits I love that b right yeah super smart I mean any of these these are the things that like previously someone would say this to me and I would just say like no because it's an administrative Nightmare and you need to have an army of accountants and lawyers to do it all and it just wouldn't make sense but I think now it totally makes sense to the point of like if you'd pitched me on the website hey we'll approach all these small businesses with predesigned websites I'd just be like oh that's a nightmare business but with an agent that's a great business totally okay so you you started off this conversation grumpy Charlie Munger and you've now ended the conversation no no no to be clear I'm still saying almost all these businesses will be zeros in five years right right but but there's a possibility that there's something and I think that you know I would say there there's a 20 or a 10% chance like five years ago pre AI of starting a business and having success and now I'm just like oh I think it's like a a three to five% for most businesses because I think the competition is just so profound the counterargument is it's so hard to predict even five months from now that how are we going to predict what's going to happen in five years from now well I just think um you know the Dario amade quote of like you know uh all keyboard jobs are gone within two years like if that is true then like I think like all all businesses are hard right I'm I'm more just going you know that maybe that's not a foregone conclusion I'm just saying hard is coming competition is coming and I think the moment that someone can just prompt an llm to compete with you and like let's say I could go to an llm like Manis and I could say hey Manis um I want you to build a calorie tracker to compete with Cal and I want you to beat it and that's all you have to do which is totally possible in my opinion I don't see why that couldn't get to the point of being real within two to three years so I just think that's a hard world to be a business person in it's exciting it's the most excited I've ever been for business because it's easier than ever to start a business but the worst businesses are the ones that are easy to start that's why I think audience brand is really important like for example Bank of vibe coding that's just sticky so you and I have personal monopolies right one of the reasons I've spent so much time over the last couple years building an audience is because distribution like you said is valuable and no one if someone resonates with you or me or Sam par or whoever then they're going to stick around and you know keep consuming your content so I think that's an unfair competitive Advantage yeah exactly um also with that Vibe coding idea the Bank of vibe coding you're also if you build it now you're integrated right and if you get a th000 Vibe coders to go build stuff and you own 10% of a thousand Vibe coders businesses like that might be enough to set you up for Life yeah go V VCB it's like uh svb except uh Vibe coding bank I like it you should do that I would I would love to invest in that if you want a partner um i' would love to partner with you on anything man awesome that'd be great um before we head out I'm just curious I know you are building an app I think it's called Vibe is that what it's called Yeah so basically um the quick version on it is I used to dress like a total Schmo and then I got divorced and I was like okay I need to dress better I hired a personal stylist which sounds really like fancy but it's actually not very expensive and it was great she'd send me like nice outfits to wear and stuff but I'd have to literally text this woman and be like Oh should I wear this shirt with this or whatever and so I started just uploading photos to chat gbt and I'd be like hey I want to wear these jeans today like what goes with it and then as I'd get dressed I'd just send more and more photos and it would be like oh tussle your hair and like um wear this watch that you have and then I got more advanced I started prompting it with all the clothes I had um and then I was like oh this is like a cool thin rapper and so I hired a agency that I know and for you know 30 grand we threw together this app called Vibe it's in the App Store anyone can go look at it and I'm actually on the hunt that was the when I when we were talking earlier about uh Manis digging through all the applicants so I had about 50 people apply I've got a couple candidates that are at the top but I need someone to run this thing so I would love if any of uh any of you folks out there listening would want to run this uh I you have to bootstrap it or raise money for it I'm not going to put in any money uh you need to not need a salary but I'll give you tons of equity that's the gist and how do people apply um just email me cool I won't I won't say in my email they figure it out it's pretty easy cool all right I won't I won't include your email in the show notes but uh comment comment below also if what you think of the idea and and uh Andrew thanks again for go ahead oh yeah the I mean the cool the uni unique thing about it is you take photos of all your wardrobe and then it'll tell you like hey these are outfits that'll work so you be like I'm going on a date night and it's a summer night what should I wear and then it'll Bas it all off your wardrobe question on on this business idea is this a CI idea or is this a a big business in five 100% this is a cal ey this is like you're I I want like some college kid who's like I want to get in and get out I want to come in I want to get it to a couple million dollars of AR I want to cash flow it and then maybe it's a thing in two years but I have a feeling this is like a moment in time I appreciate that Honesty by the way that's a depressing pitch I just want someone to do something with it but I don't know if it's a big long-term opportunity yeah cool I appreciate the honesty Andrew this is you have an open invite to come back whenever you want whenever you want to be optimistic pessimistic God ideas Trends you know where to find us thanks for coming on and sharing uh sharing some ideas yeah man thanks for having me talk to later later [Music]
