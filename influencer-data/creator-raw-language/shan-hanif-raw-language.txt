my agency does $23 million a year. i'm going to show you exactly how we do it, step by step, nothing held back. first, let's talk numbers. we have 47 employees, 300+ clients, and our average client pays us $6,400 per month. our margins? 42%. that's $9.6 million in profit. these aren't inflated numbers. these are audited financials. how did we get here? cold outreach. but not the way you think. we send 50,000 emails per month and book 200 calls. our close rate? 23%. that's 46 new clients every single month. most agencies close at 5%. we close at 23%. the difference? systems. here's the framework that changed everything. we call it the triple c system - capture, convert, compound. every part of our business fits into one of these three pillars. i developed this after failing with three different agencies. each failure taught me something critical. capture is about getting attention at scale. we use 20 different email domains, rotating ips, and ai-personalized copy. but the secret? we sell the meeting, not the service. nobody wants to buy agency services. they want to explore if you can solve their problem. our subject lines get 67% open rates. how? we make them about the prospect, not us. "quick question about [company name]'s q4 goals" beats "we can help you grow" every single time. i tested 10,000 variations to find this pattern. the body copy is 47 words max. three sentences. first sentence acknowledges their situation. second sentence hints at a solution. third sentence asks for 15 minutes. that's it. longer emails don't convert better. they convert worse. convert is where most agencies fail. they get on calls and pitch. we diagnose. our sales calls are 70% listening, 20% diagnosing, 10% prescribing. by the time we present our solution, it's exactly what they need. the prospect sells themselves. i personally built a sales framework that took us from 5% to 23% close rate. it's seven steps, completely scripted, but feels a natural conversation. every objection has been mapped and handled. we role-play this daily. step one: pattern interrupt. we start with "before we dive in, can i share what usually happens on these calls and see if we can avoid that?" this immediately differentiates us. step two: diagnose the real problem. not what they think it is, but what it is. step three: quantify the impact. we calculate exactly how much this problem costs them monthly. step four: future pace the solution. we paint a picture of their business after we solve this. step five: present our process, not our service. step six: handle objections preemptively. we bring up their concerns before they do. step seven: temperature check close. "on a scale of 1-10, where are you on moving forward?" anything below 8, we diagnose the gap. compound is about maximizing lifetime value. our average client stays for 19 months. industry average? 3 months. the difference? we deliver results in week one, not month three. our onboarding is a revenue-generating event. about our offer. we guarantee 30 qualified appointments in 30 days or we work for free. bold? yes. but we've only had to honor it twice in three years. why? because our system is bulletproof. the actual service is systematized to perfection. every client gets the same onboarding, same processes, same deliverables. we're not an agency, we're a machine. new clients are profitable day one because everything is templated. our tech stack is simple. hubspot for crm, instantly for cold email, calendly for booking, slack for communication, and clickup for project management. total cost? $3,200 per month. that's it. no fancy tools needed. now, scaling. from zero to $100k per month took 18 months. from $100k to $1 million took 6 months. the difference? systems and people. i stopped doing the work and started building the machine. i hired operators, not experts. i can teach someone our system in two weeks. but finding someone who executes consistently? that's gold. we pay operators $65k base plus 10% of the revenue they manage. top operators make $150k+. our hiring process is brutal. 500 applications, 50 phone screens, 10 final interviews, 1 hire. we test for reliability, not skill. skills can be taught. character can't. one bad hire costs us $40,000 minimum. training is everything. new hires shadow for one week, practice for one week, then handle real clients with supervision for two weeks. by week four, they're fully operational. we invest $8,000 per hire in training. our daily metrics dashboard tracks everything. emails sent, opens, replies, meetings booked, calls completed, deals closed. every number has a target and someone responsible. miss your target three days in a row? we have a problem. i review every metric daily at 9 am. takes 15 minutes. any red flags get addressed immediately. this discipline is why we've grown 340% year-over-year for three straight years. consistency beats intensity. here's what nobody tells you about eight figures - it's not harder than six figures, it's different. six figures is about skill. seven figures is about systems. eight figures is about people. nine figures is about capital allocation. the biggest breakthrough? productizing our service. we have three tiers, non-negotiable pricing, and standardized delivery. clients buy outcomes, not hours. tier one: $3,500 for 15 appointments. tier two: $6,500 for 30 appointments. tier three: $12,000 for 60 appointments. fulfillment costs us 30% of revenue. sales costs 15%. operations costs 13%. that leaves 42% profit. these margins are possible because we refuse to customize. customization is where agencies die. client retention is our secret weapon. month one, we over-deliver. month two, we systematize. month three and beyond, we optimize. we increase prices 20% annually for existing clients. they stay because results keep improving. our client success team calls every client weekly. not to upsell, but to ensure they're maximizing appointments. this proactive approach reduces churn by 60%. clients don't leave if they're getting results. competition doesn't matter. while they're copying our old strategies, we're three moves ahead. we document everything we do publicly. why? because execution is everything. knowing what to do means nothing without doing it. if i was starting today, here's exactly what i'd do. pick one service, one niche, one channel. master it. hit $50k per month. then systematize everything and scale. don't chase shiny objects. chase boring consistency. the service? cold email for appointments. the niche? b2b saas companies between $1-10m revenue. the channel? linkedin for authority, cold email for acquisition. this exact combination built our first million. most agencies fail because they're trying to be agencies. stop that. be a machine that produces a specific outcome. we produce qualified appointments. that's it. we don't do branding, websites, or social media. appointments. this isn't sexy. it's not innovative. it's execution at the highest level. but that's exactly why it works. while everyone's chasing the next trend, we're printing money with the fundamentals. my day starts at 5 am. gym until 6:30. office by 7. i work on the business until noon, then in the business until 5. home by 6 for family time. in bed by 10. this routine has been the same for 1,000+ days. the truth about wealth? it's boring. it's doing the same profitable thing over and over. it's saying no to 99% of opportunities. it's focusing on one thing until it's unstoppable. that's how we built $23 million. i failed seven times before this worked. each failure cost me money but gave me data. the data became insights. the insights became systems. the systems became millions. failure is expensive education. listen, if you want to build an agency, stop thinking an agency owner. think a factory owner. build machines, not services. hire operators, not artists. sell outcomes, not time. that's the blueprint. we're not special. we're not geniuses. we execute better than 99% of agencies. we do what we say we'll do, when we say we'll do it, every single time. that's worth $23 million per year.
