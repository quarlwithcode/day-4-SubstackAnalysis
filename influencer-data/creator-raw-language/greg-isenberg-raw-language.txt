transcript ======================================== cal aai is cool i downloaded that app and it's amazing but there's going to be a hundred of them in the app store in two months and then cal will not be able to charge what they are and i go those are good oneoff bites those are good for going from a college dorm to being a millionaire but they're not going to get you to a decamillionaire your equity value is toast within a short period of time because i think the pricing ultimately goes to zero what do as a business that you can implement ai or build an agent that can still be highly competitive and successful in two or three years if you want to build an ai business you need either a data advantage or a network effect advantage it's never been easier to build a million-dollar business and it's never been easier to lose all your equity value i think that's a hard world to be a business person and it's exciting it's the most excited i've ever been for business because it's easier than ever to start a business but the worst businesses are the ones that are easy to [music] start good to see you good to see you too man today i was thinking we can talk about where are you seeing the opportunities now with ai because in my mind i i know you look up to the charlie mongers and war buffets of the world value investing warren buffett and charlie munger value investing what does that mean it means seeing a rough in the diamonds and and seeing opportunity and i'm curious where are you seeing opportunity in this world of ai agents and and ai in general the hard part is that in a lot of instances it's a sustaining innovation and what by that is it's a new technology that will drop the cost let's say that you're we were talking about recruiting businesses let's say you start a online recruiting business or you buy an online recruiting business and they have a 20 person outbound email team you might think you're a genius because you're oh i'll get a an outbound recruiter agent that will replace all those people and now my margins will be way higher but what happens is maybe for 6 months you get that arbitrage but all of your competitors have the same realization within 6 12 months months and then the price drops and you're in the same business and maybe it's even more competitive than before it's one of the most interesting times to be an investor and entrepreneur because we've always been building sand castles on the beach in tech we all knew anyone can compete you start a to-do list software business and anyone at any time can launch a competitor it's that before there was a finite number of coders in the world there was only much venture capital money out there and there was less competition now you get far more competition in far more niches and moes matter more than ever where a mo before might have been i make funeral home management software and the moat is that it's too small of a market for venture capital to play in and none of the other people that own funeral homes know how to code but that's not not a mode anymore what a real mode would be is i have software that allows funeral homes to keep track of all their inventory and trade it back and forth or buy it and then you have a network effect now someone can't go vibe code that in a weekend because now you have a network effect social networks are interesting communities are interesting but most tools have become a 100 times harder yeah i i totally agree i want to i want to get more tactical i'm trying to think what everyone agrees everyone agrees that i can't tell you how many distribution is the new moat tweet i've seen in the last three weeks it's everyone has finally agreed that distribution is the new mo that anyone could create anything the latest thing is by the way that vibe coding is don't vibe code your way to production code that's the latest meme that's going around cuz i don't know if you saw there was this viral post that this guy was using cursor and he ended up posting it production code and then he got hacked and bad things could happen i agree with all those things and 99% of people listening to this agree what's our next step i want to treat this as and we've done this before i've you've called me i've called you and been what do we do here i've got i've got a bunch of ideas i wrote down a bunch of ideas for things people could build as as we usually do the problem as i look at it is almost all of them can be competed away quickly it's been it's never been easier to build a million-dollar business and it's never been easier to lose all your equity value it's going to be easy to have gold rush oh hey peter levels can launch this flight imator and make a million dollar but is that a sustainable business in two years when there's a thousand of these flight simulators i don't know what the opportunity is it's a bit of a sad answer i i'm not seeing a lot of opportunities to go and buy or start businesses where there's a sustainable competitive advantage there's a cost advantage there's a time advantage but i'm not i would be curious to put that back to you what do as a business that you can implement ai or build an agent that can still be highly competitive and successful in two or three years because i'm increasingly of the mind that for all tools all middlemen businesses are gone and fundamentally that we are all going to go to the search bar and the new search bar is chat gbt and you're going to query it and chat gbt will build you need or it'll hook into apis you need and the only things that matter at this point now are real world goods and services compute or network effects of some kind i i don't that answer what what have you got i'd love to hear your answer to this my take is if you want to build an ai business you need either a data advantage or a network effect advantage what does that mean for us it means that we probably shouldn't be buying or incubating ai businesses today quick break in the pod to tell you a little bit about startup empire startup empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people me you who want to build out their startup ideas now they're looking for content to help accelerate that they're looking for potential co-founders they're looking for tutorials from people me to come in and tell them how do you do email marketing how do you build an audience how do you go viral on twitter all these different things that's exactly what startup empire is and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but they're not seeing the traction that they need you can check out the link to startup empire.co in the description the advant what i what i'm interested in doing frankly and and i'm giving my playbook here but it's it's i would i would either want to buy media businesses or incubate media businesses why because that if you assume that you can vibe code software and you can create the most beautiful to-do list app i saw someone vibe code their way to things three a clone of things 3 which is something that i've used for for many years now in minutes and it works and it's beautiful if you can assume that you can vibe code things three which for me was an aha moment around beautiful software to-do list app then the opportunities in either buying media businesses incubating media businesses and then once you've built that network effect then you can start saying now how do i get these people's data that's your next step your first step is how do i get your the attention next step is how do i get your data and then the third step is how can i build assistance co-pilots ai software to monetize and build a sustainable business what would be the media business that you would want to buy because i maybe i have a different take but i want to hear what you're imagining what let's say you could press a button and buy magically buy the company of your choice what company would it be i'll tell you my framework for thinking about what would be a good company to buy i want it to be a high value niche i wouldn't want it to be i don't en i i envy mr beast in a lot of ways but on on on the other hand i don't envy mr beast he's got billions of people looking at him but they're they're low value i'm talking purely economical i want a he's got to sell stuff to kids and kids don't have money exactly but i'll i'll i'll give one i i'll give two two businesses that would be interesting to buy that are high value that are probably under monetized one is tech runch which has a great brand name to you and i we have many memories from the silicon valley early silicon valley days launching on tech runch that thing where it was bought by aol yeah michael arrington was the guy who started it and then he sold in what 2008 or something exactly i bet you there's a deal to be had where they're probably struggling they're trying to probably figure out who they are what they are but they've got a high value value niche with a great brand i would buy something tech runch the other the other interesting thing to buy would be a sought-after event series my dream you ask who my dream company would to buy would be if i can buy south by southwest ted is for sale now maybe you should buy that i didn't know is is that is that for real yeah it's for it's for real it's public knowledge now they're shopping it around and he's gonna give it he's gonna give it away to whoever is going to be the best new owner of it maybe you should go pitch chris chris anderson yeah ted has done an incredible job of turning an event series into a media company but they've stopped that media company this is a perfect ted would be incredible around all these people who watch ted ted videos ideas worth spreading how do you give them not ideas but also tools and what are those tools and how could you vi vibe code your i understand let's say you buy a yachting website and it has a big community of people that are all into yachting and they read the news on there and you're saying you could vibe code a bunch of cool data tools for example what are people paying for their yachts and how much are they paying to maintain them and then once you have that data you can sell them services and all that stuff exactly yeah that's that's smart it one we've looked at a lot of different media brands and buying these distressed assets and we've always passed because it feels it feels do you you think about what's happened to forbes now it's do you remember seeing friends post on forbes you be whoa that's crazy they're on forbes and then you realize forbs opened it up to anybody and any seo person could post on forbes and it died i'm curious i love kevin rose but relaunching dig i'm curious about that does that work and is that nostalgia worth something and i i i'm fully with you in terms of taking a community that is monetized in the wrong way and monetizing it in the way do you think that's a unique ai related thing though because that was an opportunity five years ago and it's still will be now it'll be a little easier to build it'll be easier and cheaper to build the tools to sell them yeah it was an opportunity back then two years ago three years ago but that it's a it's not a little bit easier to build it's it's significantly easier to build and also maybe even more importantly there's demand from consumers to try new apps for example the one the the flavor now is cal apps that those those companies are doing $20 million arr on on downloading an app and how hard it is to download apps and getting someone to to to to download an app that what ai has done also has made it it's it's it's created new use cases it's created with c for example you take a picture and it tells you using llms how many calories it is that's cool you couldn't do that a few years ago it's interesting i got to have dinner with charlie munger for the first time six years ago and he's at the time he was 97 and we would we would be talking about all these different ideas for investments and he would always say it's hard investing is hard and i was it was a 2018 or i was at my peak in terms of no one else was doing what we're doing we're on a buying frenzy we're valuations are great and i was what is this old guy talking about and what i realized in retrospect is is that he he got such a big scale and such a competitive part of the market where you're buying businesses for 10 billion dollars to move the needle that it becomes inherently competitive and that is happening in in all arenas now and i am becoming i'm slowly becoming the crusty old man at the table where think about all the things that were easy to start before newsletters and all that stuff i think there will be almost unlimited competition in all these arenas whether it's apps now the example is cal ai is cool i downloaded that app and it's amazing and there's tons of those but there's going to be a hundred of them in the app store in two months and then cal will not be able to charge what they are and i go those are good oneoff bites those are good for going from a college dorm to being a millionaire but they're not going to get you to a decamillionaire your equity value is toast within a short period of time because i think the pricing ultimately goes to zero and all as for newsletters and attention in general i recently i own a a local newsletter business and i was goofing around with lindy and i was able in about an hour to build a a lindy agent that could go through it would choose a i i chose a city a city near me and i said every day i want you to there's three different agents one sources all the news and it goes through local reddit forums local news websites or and then another one that takes it all and writes it and punches it up and makes it fun and cool or and then the other one that formats it as a newsletter and it is perfect it is better than any local news letter that i could write and it's more detailed because it goes to all these different sources and it even fact checks itself i think it's going to become crazy i it's going to all of our inboxes are going to get overloaded with great content that's written by ai and a lot of these businesses are going to get freaking hard what the other thing that's interesting is when you talk about data i find that whole thing interesting because data and a network effect are interl where i was talking to someone at at one of the frontier models i won't say who but i was oh we own all these social networks or and they have all this interesting proprietary data and he was oh yeah we probably ate all that they they've gobbled up the entire internet and yeah you can go and sue them but even a data it's not a data moe because now all your data probably exists within an llm already i it's hard to identify what is unique data because all they need to do is gobble up a big enough sample size to have it be predictable in almost any arena let's talk about i want to talk about a few things because you talked about a lot of things here the ci example if i was ci what i would have tried to i would have acknowledged the fact that they're going to get a thousand competitors and i would have said how do i create a network effect in this app it doesn't look they're doing that i i don't know but it doesn't look they're doing that all the people that have downloaded cal are people interested in health and tracking their health healthy lifestyle and maybe they want to lose weight does the modern weight watchers which was a multi-billion dollar company that oprah was a part of does the modern weight weight watchers start looking a cal ey in 2025 probably but they had to build the network effects to go there but weight watchers started as a physical moe because you'd go to a meet up in your town and then you'd have all this social buyin and you have people that are in your network selling you cal or these these guys i don't know what my advice would be if that guy came to me i'd probably be sell find someone who doesn't understand ai and sell it and be look the ar keeps going up you should buy this for $5 million and and ghetto because personally i tried cal but i also think i tried two or three others and i ultimately found a tool that was cheaper and maybe i'm a cheap bastard but they get bifurcated into there's all these ai photo editors on iphone and they're for suckers it's do a 7-day free trial and then it's $49 every two weeks and you're suddenly spending $1,500 a year for a basic ai photo editor there's those guys and they're borderline criminal i find that crazy and then there's people that'll create these things for free or a dollar and and then ultimately apple will eat them and this is this is the largest the the people that will ultimately capture a lot of this value are going to be whoever controls the devices because i do believe a lot of these llm a lot of this functionality will ely be implemented if you can find a niche let's talk about two different things one is buying a business or starting a business that is a five or a 10 year business and then separately we can talk about how to make your first million bucks because there's nothing wrong with making your first million bucks and building a vibe coded crappy app and and then it disappearing into years that's awesome that's a great win but for guys you and me it's got to be something that is sustainable yeah why don't we talk about should we should we dig into a couple ideas first of all before we dig into that i'm curious we should talk about what automations and tools we're using i'd love to hear what you're doing now now currently i'm spending a lot of time with gum loop have you have you played with gum loop at all gum loop if understand it's similar to make or lindy yeah exactly it it's similar and by the way i don't it's not i'm recommending one platform or another platform my my mo now is to get smart on all the platforms and i'm starting to notice that there's something i more in lindy and there's something i more of gum loop there's something i hate about gum loop that lindy or someone else does better my recommendation is to try them all and see what you and you don't but i'm my company has been running on zapier for the last four four years and zapier has been good to us and and when i found zapier it was a gamechanger for our business we were automating much stuff that we had human beings do for example sales leads we would have someone go in every day look into our sales crm and report back who are these leads is this a good lead is this a bad lead and then create reports with zapier which was cool we created a slack channel and every lead gets scored and gets put into the slack channel and the whole team gets to see the sales lead it's to me i'm looking at that as co-owner of the business i'm this is amazing but the the problem was the there wasn't much intelligence meaning it was more of the scoring wasn't good it's boolean if this then that if it doesn't match perfectly it's messed up it's messed up what it did was it posted it to a slack channel with gum loop now we can go and say this sales lead came in andrew wi andrew tiny.com who is tiny what time did he come in was this at two in the morning maybe people at two in the morning want our services way more maybe we can charge them more because he came in at two in the morning what is the size of tiny how many companies do they own what is the revenue how many employees and it and add intelligence in that in that process from a sales perspective doing that with gum loop has been fun and do you guys do let's say a lead comes in do you have an ai agent email them back and say hey can you tell me more about your company exactly that's cool that's cool yeah but only if it's not maybe a let's say we would score you as a 10 on 10 lead someone you might not want an agent to reach out to you you might a fake person and it's got to be delayed a certain amount of time i know but i also think that people are saying that agents are going to automate 20 everything 247 there's some things that the human touch is going to be better me recording a vid if you if you signed up to one of our forms maybe me recording a video and being hey this is greg we have a common friend in shan pory i'd love to talk to you about our service that probably would be better at this stage with a human in the loop in my opinion totally but i do i do believe soon greg can be an agent and be a video that looks you yeah yeah i agree i've been messing around with that that's top of mine now and then the other thing that's top of mine and i want to hear what you you've been up to is manis aai playing with manis ai it's crazy it's cool i i my i i was i always have this problem where i get excited about a a project and then i go on twitter and i'm hey i need someone to run this thing or i'm hiring for this role and then i get 50 emails and i did that recently with a project which i'll talk about later and i got many applicants and i dread it because i i hate going through all the applicants and if i hand it off to my assistant she she's busy with other stuff and she doesn't know what to look for or and i took all those emails i exported them out of gmail as a zip and i uploaded 50 candidates to manis and then it spent 30 minutes scoring them all based on what i needed and it was these are the best three people and then i focused on those people and it was totally bang on cool yeah and it's unbiased too even if it i'm not saying your bias but everyone has some biases to any of their decisions subconscious or not that that's also cool is you can say the llms have biases too though they have human they have human bias because they're trained on our data exactly yeah i'll tell you a sampling of the things i'm doing one of the dumbest automations i built recently but i find satisfying is i have a lindy agent that looks at my calendar events when i create them and it adds an emoji which is simple but now my calendar looks beautiful more impressive than that i built a lindy agent that does what you're talking about it ingests every single email that i get and then it labels it or archives it based on context and i have all these examples of different kinds of emails and and then if it's something that i'm likely to say to it'll draft the no email for me and i've tried superum and sara and a bunch of these other ones but i ultimately wanted to roll my own and have it know exactly how it worked and that's been amazing the other tool i've been using a lot is versel vzer if you messed with that dude crazy i i own a a pressure washing business locally and it's i run it with some kid locally it's for for a hobby project or i don't have time to dig in and make the website better but they did this version him and a guy that worked for me did this version of the website which is it's fine but it could be much better and i threw into into vzer and in 30 seconds it had completely punched up the website and we had code for it to me that is mindboggling that is something i previously would have spent a month maybe doing that that's been cool but the thing i want to talk about and go deep on in this episode is mcp it's [ __ ] cool i've been implementing a bunch of that stuff custom and i think that might be a my first million opportunity for somebody to do mcp and i'm curious are you using mcp for anything now i i haven't no i'm not i am not there yet yeah why don't we dive in i've got i've got a bunch of ideas but the first one is mcp stands for model what is it model context protocol and it's a it's a way of piping in data or apis into an llm the llm can query your data set and i had this total breakthrough with claude maybe three months ago one of the things i love about a is it's i find it's a bicycle for productivity i get much more done and one of the main reasons i get more done is because i don't have to ask questions of other people one of the things that would often happen to me would be it's it's a sunday i'm working and i i want to know hey what's happening in this business with our margin or how much are we spending on slack or these random questions and those would be things that unless i wanted to get fiddly and dive into a bunch of accounting or i would email to somebody i would lose interest in that problem let's say i was cost cutting or something that i'd lose interest in the problem because i have to wait four days for the answer and then i'd find out on thursday what i what i did is i went to claude and i said hey what information would you need from zero to be able to give me a full financial analysis on my business and it gave me a list and took 20 minutes but i went and i exported all the csv files out of zero i trained a cloud project and it was on my accounting for all my personal holding company and my personal life for the last two years and it was magic absolute magic at one point i said how could you optimize my taxes and it said oh you have a credit line over here and you have a credit line in your company if you use the company money to pay down the personal credit line you can immediately write off it's it was $100,000 of tax savings or something that to me that was oh my god this is magic and when i learned about mcp i saw that as an opportunity to try and get live data because the annoying thing about the cloud project is it's all historical data and it's all got to be manually updated and i hired a developer to work with me came to my house and went on my computer and set it all up or but we got it working and it's cool now i can say it's linked to all my all the companies that use certain quickbooks or zero or and i can query and i can say something across all my companies what's happening with revenue or how much are we spending on this thing or query it is and it can make graphs and charts and tables and it's not perfect i'd say sometimes the numbers are wrong but it's a breakthrough and the opportunity here is to make the easy oneclick way to do this an mcp server for the mac where you can say i want to integrate all these apis and then it manages downloading the databases onto your computer it manages the interface with claud and i know there's a few people that have tried to do this but i don't think anyone's done it properly and and a service business around it i might not want i might not want to hire developer to do this myself and figure it out but if someone could go and probably charging monthly you probably can get away with charging monthly for something this the best way to do it would be to be the competitive advantage would be it's all about security you're the most secure you're the default think about one password is not hard anyone can vibe code one password what matters about one password is everybody knows one password has not been compromised and they trust and that's why they pay we pay 200 bucks a month or to use that software that's a huge opportunity if someone can do it properly and it might be a good one-year business it could also be a good five-year business if executed i'll give away the name for this business i would branded ascp.com think of it think about because mcp is a protocol ht http but you also have htt cps the s stands for secure if you could own i'm the secure mcp guy everywhere else is not secure and create that positioning dichotomy that that itself is going to help you win deals and if you want to own that domain you got to buy it off greg for $20,000 because i assume he bought it no i i do this on the p a lot where i give away domains and then within the first five minutes of posting someone snipes it i don't know how you you do this you people but i don't even care i i want someone to go and do this build it and and pay it back somehow i that i that idea if anyone wants to do that we should we should back them not not that they need not that they need our money yeah but it could be it could be fun it could be fun to to be involved to your earlier point we have distribution we bringue to the table exactly we're not we're not cranky old guys we we we we do bring distribution that that's a good idea also i was thinking about what you were saying about your pressure washer business and i've got another idea for someone to steal that is a simple how to make your first million that what what people should be doing is be using someone should create essentially an automated agency built on top of vzer that scrapes local businesses and prioritizes the ones that have ugly websites train it on modern design practices minimalists make them beautiful build the websites and then automatically reaches out to these small business owners and be hey i redid your website i love that click here to buy click here to buy and i'll host it and then it's 20 bucks a month to host it and then any changes you want are $10 every change exactly that and we have your credit card on file they're happy because they've got this be they think they're getting a steal they're oh my god $500 for this website and it's already done and they're gna host it for me this is incredible that the bar is low it's crazy the services businesses there's people making a fortune and they have these terrible websites and they barely do seo and there's a big opportunity to take best practices and roll them out in that arena i love that though as a first business that's an incredible idea and it might be a good long-term business at least for a while yeah have you looked into web hosting businesses ever they're they're phenomenal they're people it's an accounting accounting firm it's people don't want to switch web hosts that often it's look at godaddy godaddy is the perfect testament to why it's a good business you can have that horrible user experience in that fugly website and still be a billion dollar company totally side note i was telling my wife i was how do you how someone's in older than 30 is if they want to register a domain and they go to godaddy 100% and they or you email them and you go to their website and it's this this domain is parked by godaddy yeah exactly i got another idea here this one is half baked but it's interesting i was dealing with a difficult person via text message and i was man i want help with this i want help and and sometimes i'll take an email thread and i'll paste it into claud and get feedback or but i i started thinking i was i wish that i had a way to analyze all my text messages and somebody somebody posted publicly and said with these 2 milli context windows you can now digest five years worth of text threads and my idea this whole looks maxing trend it's these apps where you can take a photo of yourself and it'll hotter not you it'll be oh you your skin is bad and your hairlines receding and here's all the things you can do and then you keep taking photos to look better and my idea is message maxing on on your mac and this is for mac i don't know how this would work on pc but on your mac imessage syncs to a database called it's called chats. db or something that and it's a big huge 2 gigabyte sqlite database my idea is you have something to ingest that database and analyze it and it might be with a local llm because it might be too much of a pain in the ass to upload it and it tells you it could tell you a bunch of different things but one example would be it could tell you which of your friends or contacts is exhibiting toxic narcissistic or psychopathic traits who should you steer clear of who's being manipulative another one might be how are you exhibiting negative behaviors yourself or how are you being beta or weak in dating and interactions or that thing and then also which friends are you neglecting who should you catch up with and some of these things apple will do over time their message summaries is an indication that eventually they're going to start digesting more of your messages but i don't think that apple would ever tell you who's toxic or narcissistic or and i think this is the thing that could go viral this is a one-year business this is easy to copy someone will copy this idea when i share it they'll make a million dollars it's not a long-term business but it's a cool idea yeah i i started thinking about businesses this where i i i start with the tik tok because you can imagine what the tik tok is going to be a viral tik tok am i a narcissist showing the screen oh my god my boyfriend's a narcissist it's going to work it's a matter of figuring out the format that i call these businesses format businesses it's it's a game of figuring out the format i agree with you that it might only last a short amount of time but it probably falls into the c c it's it and this feeds into my other idea the other and what we said before of if it's highly highly secure then it can be a high quality business if you think about other applications those are the fun genen z ideas of oh who's a narcist but this would be useful for me in terms of business it could be helpful of who are you who are you messaging that you're turning off without realizing it or who's being passive aggressive because i do a lot of business over text messages having someone coach me on how to write more effective text messages is how i'm using ai and emails when i write emails i'm a i'll write back an email that says sounds good and some people will view that as passive aggressive but if i add a happy face then it's great or if i write hey greg sounds good thanks andrew and i think something that can tweak what all of your interactions in a positive way could be cool but yeah it's not a great longterm one it's this idea is grammarly but more for social relationships think about what data is in there messages are much more intimate than even email and what i'm craving i don't know that google will do this and this is another idea i have is an llm that ingests not only your messages but your email and then can tell you what's going on in your life when i go to chat gpt you can say something there's a cool prompt that's going around on tik tok that's based on what about me tell me what tell me what psychological insights you can tell me and i did it and it was oh you're you're a searcher you're always searching for the next thing or it is and it's got all these different insights and they're it's almost horoscopes but they're real i i did this thing recently where i told lindy to look at my last 250 emails i had sent and then say what projects am i working on and what's the status of each and it was crazy how it was able to summarize everything that i'm working on based on my email and that i don't know who's going to do it but whoever does that will do and it's probably google but apparently the processing required to do it is difficult the idea the the startup idea there would be to build what i did is i used lindy and lindy sends it to an llm and reads every email some people are concerned about security they don't want to do that in the same way this secure mcp idea someone could build a secure local email processor that ingests all your emails tells you what's going on and labels them and does all that on device yeah and and that's why i think this could be a bigger business you you can ev you can create a secure holding company you only work on secure products and agencies and service businesses around ai meets sec sec security probably do my last idea have you ever got a loan from a bank yeah it takes [ __ ] forever whether it's bank or private credit or any of these people it's to get a call is a week and then it's another two months of hey can you give us this document or that document and then all they do is they package it up and they send it to some wonk at head office who reviews it all and that is an llm my idea is ai based lending and the idea would be you choose a vertical you'd say i want to lend to sas companies or it is and it's hey how much do you want and then it starts asking questions and it might say oh do you use stripe link us to your stripe api hey upload your id upload your articles of incorporation and it automates all the diligence and packages it up and then at the end you still have a human who goes and verifies that there's nothing sketchy or it is but to me this seems a obvious idea and it may already exist but i haven't yet seen that if i could go and get a $5 million loan in 48 hours for buying a business that would be incredible and i don't know why that's not possible other than the fact that it's this antiquated industry i have a an idea similar to this i want to share did at shl sahill linia tweeted i want to give $100,000 to any vibe coders that will give me 10% profit in exchange for that did this no h when viral thought it was interesting here's the idea a little mix of sahil's idea and your idea it's the bank of v coding.com and it's it's this it's an ai l lending llm where you take a percentage of of course you you're not going to accept everyone but you there's criteria in the llm that says who who are have you maybe launched successful projects in in the past have you do you have more than 10,000 followers on x is the project are the projects that you're going to work on have stripe integration of course you need that and then you take a percentage of profits i love that b yeah super smart any of these these are the things that previously someone would say this to me and i would say no because it's an administrative nightmare and you need to have an army of accountants and lawyers to do it all and it wouldn't make sense but now it totally makes sense to the point of if you'd pitched me on the website hey we'll approach all these small businesses with predesigned websites i'd be oh that's a nightmare business but with an agent that's a great business totally you you started off this conversation grumpy charlie munger and you've now ended the conversation no no no to be clear i'm still saying almost all these businesses will be zeros in five years but but there's a possibility that there's something and that i would say there there's a 20 or a 10% chance five years ago pre ai of starting a business and having success and now i'm oh it's a a three to five% for most businesses because the competition is profound the counterargument is it's hard to predict even five months from now that how are we going to predict what's going to happen in five years from now i think the dario amade quote of all keyboard jobs are gone within two years if that is true then all all businesses are hard i'm i'm more going that maybe that's not a foregone conclusion i'm saying hard is coming competition is coming and the moment that someone can prompt an llm to compete with you and let's say i could go to an llm manis and i could say hey manis i want you to build a calorie tracker to compete with cal and i want you to beat it and that's all you have to do which is totally possible in my opinion i don't see why that couldn't get to the point of being real within two to three years i think that's a hard world to be a business person in it's exciting it's the most excited i've ever been for business because it's easier than ever to start a business but the worst businesses are the ones that are easy to start that's why audience brand is important for example bank of vibe coding that's sticky you and i have personal monopolies one of the reasons i've spent much time over the last couple years building an audience is because distribution you said is valuable and no one if someone resonates with you or me or sam par or whoever then they're going to stick around and keep consuming your content that's an unfair competitive advantage yeah exactly also with that vibe coding idea the bank of vibe coding you're also if you build it now you're integrated and if you get a th000 vibe coders to go build stuff and you own 10% of a thousand vibe coders businesses that might be enough to set you up for life yeah go v vcb it's svb except vibe coding bank i it you should do that i would i would love to invest in that if you want a partner i' would love to partner with you on anything man awesome that'd be great before we head out i'm curious i know you are building an app it's called vibe is that what it's called yeah the quick version on it is i used to dress a total schmo and then i got divorced and i was i need to dress better i hired a personal stylist which sounds fancy but it's not expensive and it was great she'd send me nice outfits to wear but i'd have to text this woman and be oh should i wear this shirt with this or and i started uploading photos to chat gbt and i'd be hey i want to wear these jeans today what goes with it and then as i'd get dressed i'd send more and more photos and it would be oh tussle your hair and wear this watch that you have and then i got more advanced i started prompting it with all the clothes i had and then i was oh this is a cool thin rapper and i hired a agency that i know and for 30 grand we threw together this app called vibe it's in the app store anyone can go look at it and i'm on the hunt that was the when i when we were talking earlier about manis digging through all the applicants i had about 50 people apply i've got a couple candidates that are at the top but i need someone to run this thing i would love if any of any of you folks out there listening would want to run this i you have to bootstrap it or raise money for it i'm not going to put in any money you need to not need a salary but i'll give you tons of equity that's the gist and how do people apply email me cool i won't i won't say in my email they figure it out it's easy cool all i won't i won't include your email in the show notes but comment comment below also if what you think of the idea and and andrew thanks again for go ahead oh yeah the the cool the uni unique thing about it is you take photos of all your wardrobe and then it'll tell you hey these are outfits that'll work you be i'm going on a date night and it's a summer night what should i wear and then it'll bas it all off your wardrobe question on on this business idea is this a ci idea or is this a a big business in five 100% this is a cal ey this is you're i i want some college kid who's i want to get in and get out i want to come in i want to get it to a couple million dollars of ar i want to cash flow it and then maybe it's a thing in two years but i have a feeling this is a moment in time i appreciate that honesty by the way that's a depressing pitch i want someone to do something with it but i don't know if it's a big long-term opportunity yeah cool i appreciate the honesty andrew this is you have an open invite to come back whenever you want whenever you want to be optimistic pessimistic god ideas trends where to find us thanks for coming on and sharing sharing some ideas yeah man thanks for having me talk to later later [music] transcript ======================================== sam alman says that there's going to be a oneperson soloreneur billiondoll company over the next few years now. ever since i heard him say this, it's been stuck in my head. is it possible? can you have one person come up with a billiondoll company?, it's the dream, but is it possible? um, today's episode is about completely unpacking that. uh, figuring out is it worth it? how you can structure your company that you can create a billion-dollar outcome? how how do you can create ai agents to go and do that? is this possible? um, and it's my my thinking about,, this whole thing. if i was going to start a billion-doll soloreneur business, how would i structure my my business today? and i'm going to explain everything from top to bottom. so, this is a completely free episode. people charge thousands of dollars for this. this is free. because i hope it inspires one of you to go and start something hopefully a billion dollar solo business. [music] the quote that sam alman says is we're going to see 10erson companies with billion dollar valuations soon. my in my little group chat with my tech ceo friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there was a oneperson billiondoll company which would have been unimaginable without ai and now it will happen. that quote used to sound insane. today it sounds it's possible. it sounds it could be next quarter and i'm going to explain why. um, when you think about a ai first company versus a traditional company and now we're creating ai first companies, you have a founder that manages a bunch of agents that do tasks. um, now even in sam alman's statement, he mentions that we're going to see 10 person companies with billion-dollar valuations soon. uh, he doesn't say he doesn't say this, but we're going to see that sooner and then we're going to see the one person billion dollar company. and the reason why he's he's he's saying that is because,, some of these will could become people you might not want to hire create a creator agent. you might want to hire hire a creator or you might want to hire a person that manages some of these agents. and by the way, if you stick around to the end of this video, i'm going to be an episode i'm going to be sharing exactly how i would structure a company. but yeah, ai first company. um, and then a traditional company is people managing people. you have an executive team, vp sales manages the sales team, the vp marketing man manages the marketing team, the vp engineering manage the engineering team. this is a mindset shift when you're you're starting your business. and sam alman says himself, he says the future of startups could be one person and 10,000 gpus. what he means by that is there's a lot of compute that is going to be powering the outcomes of these agents. now the old way of building a company a startup is you would come up with an idea you'd write it on a napkin. then you'd go and fund raise. maybe that's friends and family. maybe that's venture capital. you'd hire people. you'd build the product. you'd launch the product. hopefully it worked. hopefully hopefully people bought it. and then you'd scale it. and that's what you would do. and it would and it would take time and it was also not everyone had wealthy friends to hire to to raise money from and not everyone lived in san francisco. the new path is a bit different and i haven't seen anyone summarize this new path in this way. let me know if this resonates with you all. the first thing you do is you start with an audience. so, you go and start a twitter account, an instagram, a tik tok, and then you vibe code something for that audience. you launch it. um, and then you build more of a community than an audience. so, over time, as you're building an audience, you're trying to build this community, a private community or,, irl events, hardcore people who love your brand and what you're doing. and then you build,, you use ai agents for automating a lot of the work and then you go and repeat. this is the old path. this is the new path. i'm going to give you an example of of how you can do the new path. and i'm going to use myself as an example because it's it's the easiest example to give. i'm talking about myself here. before i started a lot of you all know ideouser.com which is i give this free startup idea of the day on this platform but a lot of people don't know that it started off by me tweeting startup ideas. if you think about my account, i tweet about startup ideas. people started i noticed that people them. i built a i vibecoded using cursor mostly this product called ideabouser.com. i also built a community for it called startup empire which is a private community and now i've gone and automated a lot of this here. now there is humans in the loop. the idea browser team is three people including myself. so, it's not a oneperson billion-dollar company, but it goes to show you that if you have an idea for something, start a x account or an instagram account. and then from there, you can learn about what people like, learn about the different formats that work., it took me a while to get to this format and then you can,, build that community and start automating it over time. sam alman, the co-founder of openai, said that it is the era of the idea guy, and he is not wrong. that now is an incredible time to be building a startup. and if you listen to this podcast, chances are you think so, too. now, that you can look at trends to figure out what are the startup ideas you should be building. so, that's exactly why i built ideaser.com. every single day you're going to get a free startup idea in your inbox and it's all backed by high quality data trends. how we do it? people always ask. we use ai agents to go and search what are people looking for and what are they screaming for in terms of products that you should be building and then we hand it on a silver platter for you to go check out. we do have a few paid plans that take it to the next level. give you more ideas, give you more ai agents and more almost a chat gbt for ideas with it, but you can start for free ideabrows.com. and if you're listening to this, i highly recommend it. that's the new path. another interesting thing about this era that we're in is and i want to i want to mention this every new era that we've been in 1990s with the computer revolution 2000's cloud revolution mobile and sas revolution in the 2010s brought it more leverage. what what's happened is it's been quicker to launch things and you can get to bigger outcomes through with the smaller teams. so, that's something to know about this era that we're in. and i,, we should also talk about why this is happening. why is it possible for you to go and start a business that could could potentially be a billion dollars. and i narrowed it down to these five mega trends. one is that for the first time ever services are becoming software. it used to be software as a service sas. but now with ai agents having the ability to fulfill the the service. let's say instead of hiring a social media manager, you're hiring an ai agent that does the social media managing. instead of hiring a copywriter, you're hiring a a a copywriter ai agent that goes and fulfills it. and that's the business, right? you the person listening to this are going to could go and go and create that as an ai agent and then charge hundreds of dollars or tens of dollars a month for it. this is completely unlocked a whole new set of of of businesses. second is that there's instant distribution. you can go and start an ex account or an instagram build followings or if you don't want to do that and that's not your style you can also partner with existing creators and get instant distribution. we're also this era we're in we're built on top of the shoulders of giants. you can go and integrate with open aai you can go and start a shopify these tools exist. you can go and use superbase. you can go and use netlifi. you can go and use all these different tools. um, and of course you have to pay to use these tools, but, you're accessing billions of dollars of r&d with a flick of a button. i also think that there's this new trust in small brands., there's this new trend,, shop local, right? it's almost people want indie hackers and indie startups to win. that's a big reason why peter levels and people him. people are they want to buy his products and services because they feel i'd rather buy it from him than buy it from mark zuckerberg or whoever. and then the last thing is that there's these high precision ad platforms for the first time ever. and it's not meta, it's google, it's tik tok. x is starting to get good at it. you could with the offer you can access people and they'll buy your service and then you as the person who wants to go and create a billion dollar oneperson business your core skills are going to be code leverage audience leverage and capital leverage. it was naval who who talked about this. you want you can there's only three ways in in this world where you can get leverage. in this world you can get leverage is through code and through audience and through capital. you you are trying to refine these things as much as possible. of course you you might not be the best developer but you need you want to understand it and you want to surround yourself with the products and agents that go and help create the best code. you you might want to get good at audience building and thinking about what formats are working etc etc. and then capital as is something that you build up over time. you might be thinking great i buy that there might be this opportunity to build a billion dollar oneperson business but how do i get started? and if i were getting started this is this is what i would do. i would start as a freelancer in something. i would be maybe i'm a visual designer. i'm a i'm a i'm a product designer. i i design apps, mobile apps, let's say, and then i i create a productized service around it and i say,, for $5,000, i will design your your mobile app, five screens or less. and then you get an idea for a microsass. and i did a whole epo i did a whole episode around microsass and how to start one. i can link it in the description if you're interested in that. but it's this idea. what is the one feature that you can create that you can sell to people? that's a software and then you have ai agents fulfill the actual outcome and that's the that's the way that you progress through your soloreneur journey and while you're doing it you're building an audience you you're thinking about how i could what niche you want to be what micro niche you want to be and you're getting better at it you're getting more followers every single day you're committing to posting and that could be, you could have ai agents help you in that, but you're committing to the game of building an audience. and,, i put this over here. i saw this good,, 100 proven hooks. the twitter account it came from is a guy named marada. and he summarized the hundred hooks that work pov, you found the the app that replaced your therapist or this is why your screen time is 11 hours or your parents don't know about this money hack. so,, while you're getting good at your fulfillment, you have to get good at your audience development, too. like, you this you have to live and breathe this. and that's a big part of what will make a successful $1 billion business. so, if you want to think about your org chart a little bit, this is potentially what it could be. so, you're over here, you're the solo founder, and then you have these llms that manage these agents. you have engineering agents which is code generation, testing, qa, devops, deploying. you have design agents, uiux creation, brand assets. you have marketing agents which are content creation, seo, sem, social media. you have sales agents which are lead qualifications, outreach, demo booking. you have support agents, which is ticket triage, documentation, and then you'll have data analyst agents. so, it's this whole idea around you're creating this hierarchy and you're going to have a bunch of agents fulfill it. and i said in the beginning, you might have people do some of this in the beginning uiux, you might outsource to a person. you might outsource this to a small design agency. but over time, the the idea is to have this all fulfilled by super intelligence. um, that way you can go be on your beach and things are working and you don't have to deal with people. um, and then the way this works tangibly you can think of real here's real time agent activity, right? imagine you have on your team you have a researcher, a creator, an analyst, an operator and strategist. the researcher is feeding data, the creator is generating content, the analyst is processing metrics, the operator is handling tasks, the strategist is making decisions that goes into a central database. and you have this productivity gain that you g you gain from having these agents work for you 24/7. and this is what sam was talking about.,, i can't i can't read his mind, but that he he's thinking about there is this world where you're going to have agents fulfilling these these these tasks. now, when i was thinking about this, i was like, there's obviously a world where this goes,, horribly wrong. and,, i wanted to make mention that this is this is how it could go wrong, right? you can create something and then you overautomate something and it loses the human touch and then your business goes down. you it might cap out at 100k or 300k or something and then it'll not work right. you could have bad documentation your agents could produce garbage. you can have bad quality control and then you you have mistakes. you don't have a customer contact and then you lose connection. but that,, the person that's going to end up creating this billion dollar oneperson company is going to all these things are going to be extremely dialed. all the the rules are going to be dialed. all the references are going to be completely dialed. the the output of all this is going to be as good if not better than a human being. and as the models get better over time, that'll be easier. now you have to put a lot more work into feeding context continuously giving these rules. but over time they'll get better human beings., if you have a smart person on your team, um, let's say in social media, even if they,, they they join and they only have one year of experience, but after year two and three and they see what works and the metrics are being fed into them and they understand feedback loops and they're hard workings and their goals,, they've got goals, then uh, over time,, some of my best employees have been younger people who've learned quickly. so, that's that's something to to call out. the other thing i wanted to call out, i saw this tweet today that is this guy named mark lou. he's soloreneur and he says, "how long did it take my little sas to grow? 1k mr, 2k mr, 3, 4. 1k took four months, 2k took 3 months, 3k took two months, and 4k took one month." and this guy has an audience of hundreds of thousands or hundred. yeah, it's hundreds of thousands. so, it takes time and it's not easy. i i don't want to sugarcoat it. like, it's not easy. it takes time. so, i do think that whoever is going to come up with this billion dollar,, oneperson thing. um, it might look something this. the curve might be slow and then,, suddenly all at once. i put together a 2 by two matrix to show how where the opportunity is to create agents that do work for people that you can charge money for. on the y- axis you have the value. obviously you want as much value as possible and on the x-axis is you want is you want repetition. you want as much repetition as possible. so, if you're selling social media management as an agent, you want the the customer that you're selling to to want to do that multiple times a day because if it's high repetition and it's high value, then that's where the gold mine is. so, this is where,, you want to this is the sweet spot. you want to be here. um, and you obviously don't want to be here. you don't want to have something that's low value and not repetitive because then it'll be hard to sell. you're coming up with ideas for things. think about think about it that. and then by the way, from i saw this episode i thought it was a good episode around on lenny's podcast around choosing the ai pricing archetype. i also think that there's opport thinking about how to price your ai agent business on one person business. is it going to be usagebased pricing? what does that mean? pay for what you consume. is it going to be outcome based pricing?, the win-win model, per outcome. so, for example, finn,, is a a app from intercom. and i'm sure that it's a customer support agent that, you implement on your website and if it works it res there's a resolution that happens with a customer, you get charged some amount of money. seatbased which is slack, figma, grammarly. this is going to be less and less common. the more interesting ones are going to be something usage base and outcome based there's an opportunity to if you're building your one person billion dollar company to think to do something more usage based and outcome based because this is a new type of model that you can that you could have done it before without ai but it's it's way easier to do now or you can think about a hybrid pricing model. the base fee and consumption. as you're thinking about pricing, this is the way to think about it. i tend to think that the usage based pricing and outcome based pricing is the most fastest way to to a billion. there's two more things i want to cover. not every business can be built a one person billion dollar founder business. let's talk about the ones that can and the ones that can't. if it's a digital product, yes, it can. if it's not a digital product, then you're going to need human labor. obviously it's not going to be a oneperson business. if it's b2b sas or consumer app a mobile app, yes, it could it could be a billion dollar business, but if it's a complex b2b app or b2b sas, you're going to need a sales team. you you probably don't want to do that. um, and when i'm talking about that, i'm talking about a healthcare company,, a defense company, education, uh,, selling into the fortune 500, you do need sales teams. um, can ai handle the core value? um,, if there's some you we're at at the stage now that that might not be possible for everything. thinking about the one the business that you're going to start think about the ones that it's possible today. for example, social media management. you can get it done that it researches it manages it and and it's able to create the content in a good way that it adds value. if not, you're going to need human specialists and then you can't be a oneperson business. regulatory requirements. if there's heavy regulatory requirements, you're going to need compliance. i'm talking fintech. i'm talking healthcare. um, but if there's light or none, you're you're gucci. and then, uh, network effects. you're going to want to start a oneperson business with network effects. if you don't think that it's possible that there's network effects, it's going to be possible, but it's going to be extremely hard. um, if you do have network effects in some capacity, it'll be a lot easier. to conclude, is the $1 billion solo founder possible? here's here's where i netted out on it. technically, yes. um, ai provides the leverage. so, if you have the product, the marketing, the timing, the person, um, the first solo unicorn is probably coming in 2026 to 2028. the 10 person 1 billion dollar company is probably coming uh,, sooner than that. two it's probably being built now but yes it's possible practically though it does require these per perfect conditions and that in the future as ai keeps improving it'll be easier to do this it's totally possible now it's extremely extremely extremely rare but the fact that it's even possible is absolutely cool. and it fires me up.,, this has never been possible in history that you've been able to go and potentially start a oneperson business that is worth $1 billion. for all of you listen who made it to the end let me know if this these little education episodes are interesting to you this one or the microsass episode. my goal is to teach you about a particular topic that i'm thinking about in real time and i can't wait to see the either one person billion dollar company that you create or the 10 billion dollar company you create. um, i'll keep sharing these videos and episodes for free that you can enjoy them. create something cool. and if you need a startup idea, where to find them. ideabrowser.com or continue listening to this podcast the startup ideas podcast. and i will see you in the youtube comments. i read every single one. um, and please let me know what you would me to cover next. um, micros was the first one in this educational style. this time it's the oneperson billion-dollar company. what would you next? um, because i want to cover the things that you care about and that you're trying to learn as fast as possible. happy building and have a creative day. transcript ======================================== today's episode, we are going to talk about an introduction to vibe marketing. now, if you're listening to this, you've probably heard of vibe coding, but you might have not have heard of vibe marketing, and i'm going to break down exactly what it is, why you should care, why this is going to propel your business, your startup idea, and why most people should be focusing on vibe marketing a little more than vibe coding. i'm going to give away a bunch of workflows of how you can do vibe marketing. towards the end, i'm going to talk about some of the tools that you could use. and by the end of this, you should have a good foundation of how you can get going do vibe marketing, use ai, use agents to automate a lot of the tedious marketing tasks. [music] so, uh, before i begin, if you're new to the channel, new to the startup ideas podcast, why you should listen to me. i've started and sold three ventureback companies. i was an adviser to tik tok. i was an adviser to reddit. and, uh, i am a co-founder in lca, which is a design agency for the ai age. we work with much all the biggest ai companies or software companies looking to get into ai. i know a thing or two about consumer businesses, growing them, marketing and ai. i posted this on on x and it went absolutely viral. i said vibe marketing is the new marketing. when you think about what is vibe coding, right? vibe coding is using tools bolt, raplet, lovable. what is vibe marketing? well, it's the combination of some of these vibe coding tools with things gum loop, manis, n8n, tascade, and it's using ai agents and workflows to go and build marketing campaigns. so, my co-founder, uh, boring marketer, and shout out, uh, shout out to him, james, for helping me put some of these present, uh, presentation materials together. he's the goat when it comes to vi market marketing. he said something that i totally resonate with which is marketing will resemble highfrequency stock trading in the near future. agents working 24/7 monitoring surfacing opportunities personalized micro interactions. you'll be a portfolio manager or day trader adjusting risk deploying money based on real-time market signals. i totally believe that's where we're going. why is vi marketing even happening in the first place? it's because three things have converged at the same time. one is that ai got good enough at marketing tasks. now agents can handle the execution. i don't even think that was true a month ago, by the way. this is happening in real time. two, vibe coding tools made automation accessible to non-developers. no coding required. and three, the custom tool building costs have collapsed. you can build personalized software for pennies basically. and because of that,, you can do a lot of customized marketing campaigns. the old world and the new world. the old world of marketing was having these bigger teams, 10 specialists, seo people, copywriters, designers, analytics people, media buyers. these guys were these people are working in silos., they're in meetings, they're in slack threads, and it takes a while to launch when you have a lot of people. this new world, and which gets me excited about this new world is,, you don't have to raise millions of dollars or have a huge team to go and and run with this. you need a single smart marketer with taste, of course. pair that with ai agents and workflows. we'll get into workflows by the end. i will i'm i'm not going to leave you hanging. testing tons of marketing angles in real time with hundreds hundreds of ai agents running the show launching in days, not weeks. so, before we do get into the workflows, let's talk about what you need to get started, in the vibe marketing toolkit. some of this may be obvious to to some people. you're going to want to have a vibe coding tool replet, bolt, lovable. so, um,, it it is crazy that you can with a prompt go make me a website for new homeowners that help subscribe to exclusive content with flexible payment options., today, the fact that you can put in a prompt and get a prototype is a gamecher when you're creating a lot of these marketing campaigns. uh, you're going to want to play with something nan. so, nan,, this is their their homepage, flexible ai workflow automation for technical teams. so, they have this flowchart. so, you can create these flowcharts that help you drag and drop and automate with ai agents and different tools. but i will say one thing, nand is for,, more of the experts. um, so, uh, definitely fun to play around with, but, you do need to be savvy to use it. if people want, i can do an nan, uh, demo and tutorial. uh, let me know in the comment section. uh, gum loop is a lot nadn, but there are some more guard rails. um,, the example they use on their website, you can scrape a website, scrape a website, you can ask ai, and then you can write it into a google sheets. so, uh, it's a lot nan, but there's it's a the it's more user friendly. um, and, uh, yeah, that's gum loop. um, i also did an episode with flo from lindy.ai. uh, in a lot of ways, it's similar to gum loop. um, it's it's an nan agent platform that allows you to, uh, automate a bunch of stuff. so, uh, if you haven't checked out the, um, the episode with flo, um,, we we went through how to automate, uh, a a recruiter, how to do sales prospecting, all automated, uh, all using ai agents and not one agent, hundreds, or what they call agent swarms, which is a key part of i marketing. quick break in the pod to tell you a little bit about startup empire. so, startup empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people me, you who want to build out their startup ideas. now, they're looking for content to help accelerate that. they're looking for potential co-founders. they're looking for tutorials from people me to come in and tell them, "how do you do email marketing? how do you build an audience? how do you go viral on twitter?" all these different things. that's exactly what startup empire is. and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but they're not seeing the traction that they need. you can check out the link to startupmpire.co in the description. manis, i've done an episode on manis before. um, in fact,, i threw this presentation into manis to help design and and help me think through it. so, the fact that i can do that is,, it's meta, but that's vibe marketing, right?, i i put it in here and it helps me think through what i need to put in here., it's a designer, it's a strategist, it's a mckenzie level analyst. uh, highly recommend playing with that. and then of course claude or clude as i say you can definitely use it to write. it's probably one of the best writing tools out there now. open router people know this a bit less but it's a way to get one single ai key that helps manage multiple multiple models. so, um,, if you're creating,, if if you want to use deepsseek r1 for this and open aai 03 for that, uh, using something open router is something that you're going to want to play around with. sora, i've done episodes on this before. well, chat gbt image den one of the interesting things that jacob posel said on on on the tuto on one of our tutorials on on on the channel was that he thinks that sora is you get better results on sora than you do on chat gbt image gen. but this idea that you can go into a sora or chat gbt image gen and generate these extremely high quality photos, videos and content., how doesn't that change the game in social, right? like, how,, it it helps arm you with this huge advantage, unfair advantage to go and create content that's going to resonate with your audience. so, this is something that my co-founder, boring marketing, put together for for his holding company, and it's one of those things that everyone should do. um, it's a scorecard. um, and the reason i put it in here is it's a scorecard of all the different models. you can see 40 mini, 03 mini, gro 3, uh, code 3.7, deepsee reasoner, perplexity, sonar, deep research. and it scores it by analyst brief blog. and the point of this is that certain models are going to be better for certain things for it is you're doing within vibe marketing. though i talked about when it comes to writing for example blog creation you can see at the bottom here code 3.7 it's amazing for content brief and blog creation well-crafted blog with humanlike content it understands brand voice and maintains consistency and adds relevant internal links when we add it for when when we when we add website for it to refer to now you have to figure out for yourself which which models and which llms are going to be your llm marketing friends. some things are going to be better, some things are going to be worse, and i encourage people to go and create scorecards that they know what's working for them. i will say as a caveat that these models are changing all the time. i've noticed over the last couple weeks that code 37 is getting worse at writing., you got to continue update this. so, the moment you've all been waiting for. let's see some workflows we can learn how you can copy vibe marketing pros and and start automating you and sort,, you can lay on the beach while this this weird,, robot thing is going to serve you cash. let's talk about a few workflows here. so, uh, for your stack on this, uh, you're going to want n8 to n. you're going to want a google sheets, you're going to need an ai model, you're going to need google cloud console, you're going to need, um, some data sources, social platforms or other inputs, and you're going to need open router, which we talked about before. it's access multiple ai models through one api. now, once you have that stack, you're going to be able to create a few different workflows. you'll be able to create a data analyzer, you can connect sheets with ai for insights. you'll be able to create a content monitor. you can scrape reddit and summarize with ai. you can create a competitor alert, get notifications of competitor posts, email summarizer, weekly ai summaries of emails. you can even do a meeting assistant, although this exists a a lot,, in other products. but yeah the formula is you pull data from sources, you transform it with ai, you analyze the results, you apply insights to strategy, and you create a closed loop strategy with output. this is some simple ways to create some of your first workflows. we're going to get to more interesting stuff over here. jordan mix, who is a partner at late checkout, my holding company, who has been on the pod before, had this cool thing where his workflow was the one-click crm. he was able to, you can think of the use case of this podcast, the startup ideas podcast, every single week having a here's the five guests that we should invite on the podcast. automated and it's and and vetted and reaching out based on their social links basing based on other content that they've done. so, how does it work? you step one is you trigger with gum loop browser extension. and you can check that out on your own time, but the browser extension what, i can show it to you real quick. it's this chrome extension that automates your browser with ai. basically, you can record your browser actions and replay them with a single click. no coding required. you can scrape and process web content with ai. um, super helpful. it's a chrome extension, by the way. i'm not affiliated with gum loop or yeah, i'm not affiliated with with this company at all. uh, and let's go back to the presentation. yeah, someone asked me, "are you filming with gum loop?" no, no, i i'm trying to give you the sauce. i want to see what you can create. um, and, uh, let's, uh, let's continue. so, uh, you trigger with the gum loop browser extension. you scrape the website you can get a transcript, for example, if it's a youtube video. then you can analyze the content and web search. um, you can extract the data. you get the social links and other relevant links. and then you can craft an outreach message, store it in air table, and then you can send a weekly summary to your team. now, you don't even need to use gum loop for that. you can use lindy, you can use other platforms. um, but this is super cool because it does a lot of the heavy lifting, the boring stuff around figuring out who to reach out to and and how to reach out to them. uh, this is a classic vibe marketing example. we i did a podcast on this how we built this disney pixar level videos of myself using chat gbt leonardo chat gbt was on the script writing leonardo ai cling ai stitching that together to make these beautiful images move into videos and 11 labs for for the voice and highly recommend to watch this. it's long, but it's an interesting way because why is this interesting in in the context of vibe marketing? because if you can create there's this arbitrage moment that exists now where you can go and create pixar level content that's going to fly on social media if it's good and your competitors are not. you can even create a completely aidriven newsletter. you use google appcript that takes a topic and a point of view from a google sheet and then and then uses perplexity for all the deep research code for writing and midjourney for images. imagine that a completely aidriven newsletter. now, i know some people in the comment section are going to be like, "oh my god, that's going to be ai slop." and it might it might be ai slop, but if you have the prompts and you're yeah, you have the prompts and you do have some human in the loop at some point. it it, i i wouldn't say that's it's 100% true. i've seen aidriven newsletters that are valuable and i love getting in my inbox and you you probably didn't wouldn't even know that it's ai. okay, how to scale content with vibe marketing. couple tools that we're we're using nan, google sheets, open router, open aai, and clo37. how it works, you get insight from specific subreddits. you come up with content ideas using open ai. you store the ideas. you get one idea per execution and then you use code point 3.7 to create content for linkedin, youtube video scripts and blog post. shout out to boring marketer who put this together. i think it's brilliant, right? reddit, you have all these validated ideas and then you use open ai to remix it and brainstorm. it's it helps. many people come to me and said say i i don't have time to do content i can't do content ideas i need a system for creating content this is your system vibe marketing is here sales agent you can create a use an llm to validate a raw list of leads then get info from that website analyze it generate a report and send custom outreach you don't need a junior salesperson automate it using vibe marketing e-commerce, a system that takes amazon as that's the amazon skew, uh, and runs it through seven ai agents, pulls in reviews, keywords, search behavior, turns it into a full listing, bullets, titles, back-end terms, image overlay copy, even a+ content, all structured, all conversion focused. it's having a strategist, copywriter, and seo person in one click. are you getting fired up about vibe marketing? i am talking about it and it goes on and on you can you could here's another content idea content one using nan search reddit for relevant combos in my niche how much i reddit ex extract themes painoints for content ideas and then generate psychologically powerful hooks outlines and briefs and store it in a google sheet for editing it's similar to what we saw before but thinking you maybe you do it for hooks maybe you do it for outines maybe you do it for briefs. um, this one is about,, who,, people who want to start youtube channels but need content ideas. first,, you're going to use again nan, youtube api, open ai, open router, google sheets, google cloud. how you do it? step one is you find videos. you search youtube for a keyword and fetch trending videos in your niche. uh, then you extract the info, get title, description, views, and channel details. then you store the raw data. you save that video into google sheets. analyze the content. use ai to extract content angles from titles and descriptions. generate ideas. ask idea. ask ai to suggest new video ideas based on those angles. and by the way, use the model that will come will come up with the best stuff here. and then store the results. save those angles in google sheets all in the cloud. i don't those are a few of the workflows i encourage people to go and try and come up with their own. use any tool you'd like. this is where i that the world of marketing is going to is going to change over the next 12 to 18 months. this is an image from from my co-founder where he said he says marketers using ai tools in isolated ways for specific outputs on individual channels. that's how people work today. but in the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see an interconnected ai system working together with shared contexts. you're going to have multiple ai agents and workflows. and these are going to be managed by manager agents trained by human experts. this is the future of marketing. everyone marketers will evolve from individual ex executors to orchestrator of these systems. small marketing teams of five will accomplish what previously required much larger teams. we talked about that. adding new marketing channels isn't a,, won't require hiring. it's an agent away. outputs will be more consistent and with less feedback cycles needed and systems will be goal oriented. so, it's going to be about telling your agents, hey man, i need 50,000 new organic visitors monthly. go figure out how to do it. there's going to be real time adaptation. so, real-time adaptation will occur as systems analyze market gaps, create opportunities instantly. marketing might resemble high frequency trading. we talked about that. um, you get the idea. marketing is changing much now and now is the time to get good at this vibe marketing stuff. so, what makes a good vibe marketer? that if you can think in systems, not campaigns, creating these systems, these flowcharts type things, you'll outperform. if you're good at testing relentlessly,, now you're no longer testing two ads. you're testing 50 variations, 100 variations. you're doing a lot of testing every single day. uh, and you're learning quick. um, you're frontloading value in everything you create., you build once, you distribute forever, and you let machines handle the boring stuff. by the way, if you want to see more vibe marketing tutorials, highly recommend following boring marketer on x. uh, he shares a bunch of workflows. this is his agency where he automates five marketing for folks. i'm a co-founder in this and he also has a school community which will include in the links for other vibe marketers and he charges 100 bucks lifetime to join but the price goes up every 100 members. so, for for people interested, check it out. um, that's the introduction to vi marketing. i hope that was helpful. i wanted to give you all the sauce. didn't want to hold back. um, if you enjoyed this thing, you you you got to let me know at least. so, like, comment, and sub, and share this with a friend you can go build something. i don't want you to like, comment, and subscribe. that's not fun. i want you to build something, and i want to see you win. i'm rooting for you. the best thing you can do is to play with the tools. see what you learn. put it in your schedule. every day i'm going to spend 30 minutes on this. i'm going to create a workflow. i'm going to automate this. i'm going to ask my team what are what are repetitive tasks that i can go and automate. honestly, that's the best thing you can do. and that doesn't cost you any money. so, a lot of these platforms have free trials. check it out, have fun, and and yeah, maybe we can use the comment section as a place to share share our learnings and and share how we're feeling about this. so, go get them. till next time, that was the startup ideas podcast introduction to vibe marketing. transcript ======================================== today we're going to go over the most comprehensive micro sass 101, how to build one, what that looks like, examples. i'm going to give away some startup ideas. i'm going to talk about growth flywheels. i'm going to talk about user journeys. i'm going to talk about the playbook. this is something that people charge tens of thousands, if not more, of dollars for. but today, i'm going to give it away for free because i couldn't find anywhere on the internet where it was in one place. so, my hope is that by the end of this episode, you have a good idea around how to build a microsas business, what that even means, what's the difference between sas and micros. um, and get your creative juices flowing that you can go and use ai to build some of these microsas businesses. either if you have a full-time job and you want to build something on the side if you want to learn or if you want to go all in and make microsas your main thing. let's get into it. [music] the first question is what is a microsass? um, the difference between a microsass and a full-on sas is that a microsass is focused on a niche. it's the target is is extremely niche. think of salesforce. it's targeting everyone. a microsass is a particular niche audience. um, and it also has a niche product it's a feature of a feature. um, and it's also focused on profitability, whereas,, a successful microsass might get you 10, 20, 30, 50k a month of profit. um, and it's also focused on it's also for,, you could be built with a solo or tiny team. why build one? it doesn't cost a lot of money to build. uh, typically these microass have 80 to 90% margin. from a lifestyle perspective,, we're going to get into it, but, some of these things are, they run on not that much,, it doesn't require 120 hours a week type thing. you can have 100% of the equity for for you and your team. and there's beginning to become this, marketplace or liquidity for exits for some of these things. so, let's talk about some examples. my favorite recent example is this company, bank statement converter, because it's simple. this is a business that's doing $40,000 a month of mr solo founder and it's exactly what it sounds like. you the world's most trusted quote unquote bank statement convertible. easily convert pdf bank statements from thousands of banks worldwide into a clean excel format. this is this is the whole thing, right? and, why does it work? well, it works because,, the domain is good. it it it it,, does a thing well. it's a pain point that people have. and it's simple. that's an example of what a micro sas could be. uh, another one, this one's at uh, 24k mrr is this whole idea around projecting in the future your financial net worth. um, and it's a nice way to visualize it. uh, they're pricing,,, $109 a year. so, you're talking about,, under $10 a month. um, and that's the whole business. it's just,, projecting your financial future. so, it you can see, right? you can see that these are a feature of a feature. this would be a part of a bigger thing, but they fully focus on it. and in the age of ai, you can build a startup that is a feature of a feature or micro micro sas because it's quicker, easier to build with tools cursor etc. clean voice 20k a month mr. so,, edit your podcast in 10 minutes automatically. so, it it's the features around,, removing your background noise, filler words, long silence, mouse sounds, right? so, 15,000 podcasters use it. a lot of,, i'm a podcaster and or,, have a podcast. um, so,, i have i i have i felt this pain point. i felt this painoint. so, you're you're starting starting to notice that a lot of these ideas have good brand, big pain point clear. and you can,, if if it works, you can expect,, the five to six figure a month mr range if it works. right? now, i'm not going to sugarcoat it. not everyone who's going to start a micro sas is going to work, not everyone who's going to start a startup is going to work. the odds are against you. um, but if, if you stick with me to the end of this and and if, you you ship products and you learn, um, it's going to increase your likelihood of success as what works and what doesn't work. so, we're going to talk by at the end of the episode about some of the micros. i'll give it away. and i i've been thinking about what makes the growth flywheel of a successful microsass and i've summarized it into this. first you're going to build an audience or a community and or a community. so, for example, when we first started boring.com, um,, it was a twitter account where we talked about automating marketing with ai workflow and agents and over time we built the business around it, but it started off as a x account. so, you could do the same. so, you can start by building the audience and community. from that you're going to learn about an the acute pains of that audience and community from that obviously you're going to build something you're going to build the startup and then it's going to generate some word of mouth you're going to start creating recurring revenue and then you're going to reinvest that recurring revenue into the audience and community you're going to do things irl events you're going to do things promoting posts that work for example maybe this post worked a lot you can see it got two 2,000 likes how do you put paid ads against that and then get people to sign up to your startup. that's to some in summary exactly how to think about the growth flywheel of your microsass. real quick i need to tell you about something that's helping me sleep better at night as an entrepreneur. i was running multiple companies with money scattered everywhere. zero spending visibility and making growth decisions blind. i knew there had to be a better way and my friend told me about bracks. so, i switched and now i have mission control for every dollar. spend management and visibility, virtual cards for my team, and earning cash from the same day treasury product. i was leaving much money on the table, but not anymore. i have a financial operating system for our businesses to make decisions i can spend smarter and move faster and it's been a total gamecher. i'm loving brex much. i reached out to them and asked them to sponsor the pod. if you're building something real, you need a complete financial operating system brex. it'll help you sleep better, too, and you can't be mad at that. let's talk about the user journey of a typical micro sas product. usually there's a manual workflow that people are doing that's painful. for example we talked about the the bank statement converter converter. people were doing this across a bunch of different companies and it's it's annoying to do right. there was that manual workflow that people were doing. and people look for a fix. often time they go to google or chat gpt or perplexity to find the fix. they find that micro sas. that's why having a good domain name is important. now by the way a lot of people are going to say all the dotcoms are taken that. well,, not all of the dotcoms are taken, first of all, and also these long ones that sound super long, bank statement converter. you would be surprised how many of them are not taken. they have a wow moment. they use the product, it works. of course, you need to create a high quality product. usually there's some trial to value. um, maybe it's,, a free trial for a few days. they see it works and then you start paying $19 a month. they're hopefully delighted and they tell some of their friends or you have,, you you incentivize them to share it with their slack for maybe free credits that. that creates the referral info influx which creates growth. and the other thing it creates when when you share it and and and people are sharing it on on twitter and instagram and places that, it helps with your seo. over time it compounds. and what does that look from a numbers perspective? you can think of it as you start getting 10,000 you start by getting 10 visitors a month but then it gets 100 a thousand 10,000 site visitors. but let's use as an example 10,000 site visitors a month. 1,500 of them do free trials. that gets it to 300 active users that are paying about 150 paying subscribers paying $19 a month. you end up getting about 30 advocates. and a lot of people focus on these paying subscribers, but you want to think about how do you get the top of the funnel? and that's where this audience and community piece is important because if you build an audience and community and you become a creator of some sort, you can definitely earn a lot of attention. um, and a lot of people, a lot of people say to me at least, they're like, "well,, easy for you to say you guys created this zero to 78,000 uh,, boring marketer community. um,, it's easy for you to say that like, yeah, of course you get 10,000 sites visits when you post something, but the reality is we started this account,, a year and a half or two years ago. um, and we started from zero. so, it is totally totally possible to do. um, and if you look at it from a financial perspective,, it's going to suck in the beginning, you're going to be making $0 or10 $10 a month or $100 a month. um, but it compounds. so, i want to let that if you build a good product and you're building a good audience and you're adding to both those things, both from an audience and a product perspective, your month one you,, you might do $200 a month, you might three, you might do 2,000, 6,7,000. if you reinvest these profits into ads, affiliates, and new features, it does compound assuming competition doesn't get super competitive and assuming you continue to reinvest. from an affiliate perspective, what i'm seeing is approximately 20% of, you can give 20% of your revenue to affiliates. you incentivize them with 20%. um, you can use platforms. i'm not invol i'm not involved with any of these companies, but you can use platforms rewardful to help manage that. i see a lot of microsasses use this product., i i tried to visualize what is the micro sas playbook look from a visual perspective. so, you start by finding the the itch, right? so, solve your own problem if you can because you'll know it most intimately. focus on niche. don't focus on broad and then validate it with a tweet. once you're building that audience, you can say like, "hey, would anyone want something this?" it's crazy, but there was a guy i want to bring him on the pod. josh pigford. so, this guy josh pigford, he was on ideaber.com, which i give away one free idea every single day on this product. sign up if you haven't already. but he was on he was on it and he saw he he saw the idea of the day. he said, "i'm building it." it was a micros idea. he called it name snag. it was an ai agent that finds profitable expired.com domains. and he starts building it in in public and it it got it went completely viral. he says, "saw greg eisenberg's post yesterday. sighed realized i was going to have to build it. woke up this morning at 4:30 a.m. as i do. started building. 12 hours later, we're live. say hello to namesag.com and snag a killer domain for your next idea. and then says, he says, "how long until the first dollar comes in?" and it didn't take long. 1 hour. that's long. then he goes, he says, "then it goes to $1,000." make that $1,000. and that was a few hours. it when when you're building in public this people people are rooting for you and of course you need to iterate on the idea and add and and remove and change the positioning but this is much the playbook of of how to build a microsass and public. you're going to want to build a weekend mdp. of course, you could spend a lot of time and make it perfect, but you're not going to want to do that. you're going to want to,, vibe code or hire a freelancer or do both to time constrain it to 48 hours. in josh's case, he did it in 12 hours, but that for most of us, um,, 48 hours is is a good amount of time. um, and then you're not going to want to hire people away, right? you're going to want to make,, build the confidence that you can build something and scale it. um, automate as much as you can and then tweet,, tweet your progress daily. um,, open up your dashboard and revenue. um,, maybe share some of that. um, create feedback loops and have that distribution first mindset, right? share things on igx, linkedin. there's a there's a two guys that do this well. this is this guy yonyi, he he every day he posts,, day 415, day 414, day 413. and he's talking about his startup journey. and sometimes it's good and sometimes,, self admittedly, he's like, i'm going to do my daily video. and he,, he talks about his he's learning in the arena and it got him to 176 76,000 followers from doing that. it's totally possible. there's also a guy named jack fris who does a good job. i've had him on the pod before where he does a similar thing where he just,, this is he he talks about what he's learning from,, started off in his mom's base, but now he's making $20,000 a month from his micro sass. so, short form is super super smart to do. it's i i'm i'm horrible at looking at a camera and doing short form. it is a skill. it will take you time. um, but that if you can master it and it probably is going to take you 60 days to get good at it. um, and do it every day and share what you're learning in real time and you can repurpose some of that chore form and put it on x in linkedin. so, that's something i definitely recommend you do. um, from a pricing perspective, if you can do recurring revenue because that's obviously the best. how much money you're going to come in tomorrow come in next month. charge from day one. a lot of people create free products for their micro sass because they don't feel confident in it. i would say charge from day one. you can always do discounts over time. and then kill churn with value. in the beginning, you're going to have,, a lot of churn. churn. by the way, what by that is retaining your users. the hardest part about a micro sas is people go and they cancel and you don't want them to cancel. how do you stop them from cancelling? well, you give them more and more and more and more value such that you're you're killing churn over time. don't be scared if your churn is high over time. what that means to you is you need to go and create more and more value. and your job as a ceo of this thing is to prioritize the things that will add as much value. you're playing an infinite game. you want to ship weekly improvements if not daily. um, and you want to stay,, out outsource as much as you can. build on top of giants is what by this. uh, use,, you don't want to recreate things from scratch. use things like,, throw things on the cloud. use things shopif,, shopify if you need to use things, uh,, build on top of stand on the shoulders of giants. and, uh, and i,,, what's missing from here is also be kind with your customers. try to as you're building this audience,, you're going to have haters that, but kill them with kindness. try to add as much value to as people as possible. set up,, tweet notifications it in your niche and respond to people, give value, and over time you're going to add 5 to 10 followers a day on your audience and people are going to hear about it is you're building your micro sas. a few more frameworks that i want to get into and then we'll get to some of the ideas and how to build them. but the market gap heat map you want to focus if you're thinking about what microas should i create you want to create you want to focus on the quadrant of high demand there's a lot of people that want this thing and there's few tools you don't want to focus on high demand and many tools this is a trap because this ends up getting focused it gets bomb bombarded by vcbacked startups and then you you have a huge churn problem and it's hard to earn attention. i would say try to focus initially on high demand few tools and then over time you can expand your product for example the back bank statement converter guy can go and expand into other other conversions not bank statements and then he can go into a more high demand area but initially it makes sense to go into a high demand few area. you can use tools google trends to to find out where where their demand is and you can go and see that. and then you can also i go to ideabrowser.com and see the trend section where we have different trends and you can scroll and see what is trending now where do i see an opportunity to create some micro sas o some micro sas product. um, the other thing is a lot of people end up building incredible micro sass, but they they they they do the hard work around getting attention. they get this they get 25,000 followers on x. people know of them, but they're in a space that people have low willingness to pay. so, you want to focus on high pain and high willingness to pay. you don't want to focus on low pain, low willingness, high pain, low willingness, and low pain high high status, right? when you come up with your idea for your micro sas, come back to the problem pay matrix and make sure that that people have a high willingness to pay for this product. another way to think about it is if you think about micro sas, you want to innovate in a niche and you want it to be high polished. if you think about a plugin, what is a plugin? a plugin is a shopify app. you're built on top of someone's ecosystem. you're a wordpress a wordpress app. it's niche, but it's low polish. what's a diy script? that's almost a github github repo. it's super broad, low polish. and then big box sas is where the sales forces of the world play in microsoft that. you want to focus on innovating over here and not much m market dominance, not broad. it's niche, it's high polish, you've innovated on it in some capacity. and that innovation could either be from a product perspective or even a marketing and positioning perspective. and that's that's where you want to be. okay, let's talk about a few microsass ideas that anyone could steal. my hope here is that this now that you understand a little bit about okay, what is a micro sas? how to think about what type of microsass idea i want to do? what makes a good one? a little bit of a playbook. let's talk about some ideas that probably could work that fit the bill. and anyone could steal these and and i hope you do honestly. the first idea is called permit sync. and the the the idea is that a lot of homeowners hit the wall when they their city's permit office asks for drawings and affidavit and inspection dates they never heard of. the pain is paperwork paralysis, not hammer skills. you can start by scraping public permit checklists for the 50 most active american cities. drop them into a structured database. the version one asks you three questions. you do almost a quiz. the city, the project type, and the square footage, and that spits out a pdf packet, correctly named forms and autofilled address, and the next step checklist. you can ship this in in 48 hours. i would use something nex.js, superbase, pdf kit, and then test it on a local facebook group a home rena group. by the way, people think facebook groups are dead. there's still a billion active users in facebook groups. so, you can test a lot of these microsess ideas on facebook groups. the moat is localization. so, every week you can have out two or more two more jurisdictions. you can integrate integrate edge cases the san jose wild force wildfire compliance forms etc. all right. and you can price it for $99 onetime fee for a project plus maybe an optional $19 a month sms status line. this is something that a lot of micros products do is they have a fee and then there's some upsell. think about when you're building it is,, micros you're building, what is your pricing and then what is your upsell? and then how would you grow this? um, well, you can post short form,, looms or videos, demos titled, how to pass an inspection in san francisco, how to pass an inspection in miami, and then you get seo for,, san francisco permit help. um, you try to get builder forums to link back. um, there's a big seo play for for this. um,, long-term county clerks will change forms. i acknowledge this. so, treat that churn as an opportunity. upsell them to a $299 a year contract here with automatic jurisdiction updates and multi-address dashboard. so, this is to me a fun fun micro sas idea to do, especially if you're into renovations. um, i the business model. that the growth loop makes sense around the seo. um, and it's going to compound. and for people who say like, "oh, seo is dead. seo is dead." no, seo is not dead. it's still generating tons billions of dollars of of of commerce. and if you do good seo, it's going to rank you in chat gpt anyways and perplexity anyways. so, uh, that's idea number one. idea number two, and this is one that hits home to me, is called pod pod scriptor. uh, podcasters burn two to three hours at least per episode episode polishing show notes and clipping tik tok teasers. 60-second teaser clips. the wedge is every every every rss feed holds enough metadata to automate 80% of that grunt work. you build a web hook that triggers on new episode publication, pipes audio into a diorization model, titles each timestamp, then feeds the outline and punchlines into a text to video template, captions and b-roll. you can ship an mv mvp targeting ankor.fm users which are spotify users. they drop the rss url, get a google doc and three mp4 vertical clips in a google drive. obviously, it has to be high quality, right? but i would use something this. um, and how you monetize it, you make the first episode free because you need to show value and we talked about that earlier., you want to show value early on, but then,, $29 a month up to eight episodes and then you can go usage based beyond. so, i included this idea here because usagebased as a business model for microsoft is microsass is going to get more and more common. um, and for it depends on what you're building, but, you might realize mr or or recurring revenue monthly might not make sense for what your microsass idea, but a usagebased might be the wedge to get you get a lot of people to use your thing. um, and you you can use chat gbt and you can use manis and you can use perplexity to pro project do financial projections to see if it makes sense. um, with your cost that, but i i anticipate that usage base is only going to get more and more popular and something that a lot of you should look into. um, and then from a the growth engine perspective, the omg, here's my free clip tweet is your growth engine. you embed a tiny watermark in the bottom right. um, you integrate it with dcript, riverside, and cap cut marketplaces for distribution and you do a weekly leaderboard top podcast that gains 10k views using pod scriptor and that drives fomo. so, uh,, thinking that. not only does that drive fomo, but it's interesting, right? it, uh, it's giving value back to the community. so, think about it is, microess you're building, how can you do a weekly email that keeps you top of mind that you can ultimately create an ad unit that says upgrade um, that adds a lot of value. once mr hits $10,000, roll out topic clustering that autogenerates evergreen youtube playlist and newsletter digest maybe at $49 a month. um, and you probably could exit this business at a 4 to 6x arr. okay, maybe it's 3x, maybe it's 7x, but in that range, um, that a lot of the vertical specific tools like,, a vimeo, which is publicly traded, cap cut, etc. would would buy something this. idea number three is called spec sheet. um, this is a bit of a more boring idea than in my opinion the first two. um, but listen,, bank statement converter was boring, too. so,, and it's making $40,000 a month. so, uh, sometimes sometimes you got to be boring. so, the idea is this. b2b buyers go through these long pdf spec sheets. sometimes they're 30 pages handcopying line items into an excel grid to compare chips, apis or sas tiers tiers. so, and this this is happening. it might not happen. it might not you might not think it's happening because you work at a startup or something this, but in big companies, this is happening all the time. and the large pain point here is there's decision delay. if you can build a drag and drop up up uploader with three competitor pdfs in a sortable web table, you can use something lang chain and tiboula to extract fields. then you normalize with a synonym map throughput for example versus requirements that is going to be valuable for people. you can use nex.js superbase cloud run worker to go and build this out. and you the first version you obviously wanted to be s a super tight scope compare feature flag platforms. and then landing page seated with three public pdfs. and founders are going to founders and executives and leaders of companies are going to feed this product more and more pdfs and every upload improves your synonym map. it's another reason why i i wanted to include this one is you might have a data moat with your micros. and i love data mo businesses now. if you can think about ways to get more data make the experience better then that's going to help you with your churn problem later on. pricing you can do something $49 a month. now let's talk about growth. people love slides especially in the corporate environment. you can do an add a copy to keynote button that renders a two column comparison with your logo footer. every deck shared in a board meeting is another backlink. and then the longtail seo, for example, launch darkly versus split in 2025 is yours within the quarter. something this could get to 20k mr. and you can i i think it get a lot,, bigger. for later you can resell the anonymize aggregate stats via an api you can say oh you have this data around 70% of feature flag buyers choose usagebased pricing that's unique data that someone would buy and i tweeted about this also this whole movement around paying for data i talked about cloudflare they launched pay-per crawl websites can now charge ai crawlers is for scraping content. you're going to see more of this over time. i'm particularly interested in micros that that have this data advantage. and by the way people are going to buy businesses for their data. and that's another opportunity you can go and buy if you can buy a micro a micros with data maybe they're going to value it at 2x arr or 1x arr but if you can sell the data you can increase increase that arr simply. we're going to go through two more ideas. idea number four is cart saver. shopify stores lose 70% of carts. there's all these generic complete purchase emails. um, but what if you had 11 labs, which is the voice ai cloning, and you use canvas api to autorecord a 30 second personal video for any cart more than $100. so, the app grabs the the shopper's first name, a product shot, and a founder's voice with an mp3 overlay, which is cool. and it's like, "hey, jane, noticed you love these sneakers. here's 10% off. link below." and it's a video. um, you can even say like, hey, this is an ai generated version of me, but i still think it's cool and there's an arbitrage opportunity to do this. this would this would crush. so, you create a shopify app uh,, using rails and s3 that triggers on checkout and update web hook. it renders webm with fmpeg and emails via shopify's marketing api. you can do something from a pricing perspective do 1% of recovered revenue and then how you would grow this thing is you create a twitter account an x account that's all about growing it's all about abandoned carts and and growing and growing revenue and then you do a lot of sidebyside ab graphs around how people increase conversions and then the last idea which i grabbed from ideabarabrowser.com is called grant guru. i don't know if any of you have submitted a grant but it is it is talk about painful talk about painful. it takes long it's intense. people do they try to avoid it or they give up. but if there was something called grand guru and it asked five prompts your mission, your impact, your stats, your budget, and then drafts these full proposals matching the foundation's language style and brand, that would be huge. uh, and hopefully make the world,, m give people the opportunity to to do,, their their life's work that. so, you can pilot with us-based art nonprofits. uh, the way i would do it is i would scrape a hundred winning proposals. i'd train a style transfer template. i'd build an mvp in django and stripe. i'd outputs and i'd output it in doc x with autogenerated cover letter and budget table. and then early users send feedback on tone, fine-tune by org charts, arts, environmental youth. pricing, you can do something $149 for the full proposal or subscribe for $99 a month unlimited. and then growth, you can do publish a public funded via grand guru lead leaderboard. foundations love success stories and applicants trust proven track records. there's also no one talks about these stories of how they get the the these grants. if you had a twitter account that showed this, that would be interesting to people. and then you can run webinars with grant coaches and then they become affiliates earning 20%. um, these are some of the ideas. and i bet you as you were going through it, if you're taking notes that, you you you understand now like, okay, there was a painoint, there's a wow moment, there's a trial, they tell their friends, there's a media component, right? there's this building of audience piece. um, these are focused on high margin. um, they're not they're low capex. they don't require a lot of money. oftentimes they require less than $500 to build the first version. they're extremely niche at first. you you don't a ventureback company is going to raise a billion dollars to go and build this and it's focused on profitability. it's not for everyone, right? microsass is not for everyone. it's for people the solo founder who wants,, a lifestyle business who finds this interesting. and you can end up building a bunch of these too, right? if you look at,, uh, levels.io, peter levelvels, he's probably the most famous indie hacker. he's got a that's what he has a bunch of these,, 139k a month, 40k a month, 36k a month, 22k a month, 16k a month. you can build a portfolio though of those. i call that being more of a multireneur, having multiple products. um, but, if you're starting out, you want to start with one. prove that you can get to 10k a month, 20k a month. um, and then over time you can go and build others or you can buy others. um, i said, this isn't easy. it's not you're going to follow this playbook and it's going to work. there is going to be a lot of pain and there's going to be a lot of zigs and there's going to be a lot of zaggings. but if you can figure out how to build audience and community and you can figure out how to build products that speak to the pain, um, then you you're iterating and and you're building audience. you're getting more and more people and your product's getting more and more value. your retention is going more and more down. your engagement is going more and more up. your word of mouth's going more and more up. um, and and it could be extremely life-changing. so, i hope this was helpful for people. i tried to make this as concise but comprehensive as i possibly could. i put a lot of work into this. um, if you episode episodes this of the startup ideas podcast, please please and comment i know to do more of it. um, and that because otherwise otherwise i won't do it., i want to create i want to i want to i want to create value for you for you. and the last thing i'll say is,, i i thinking about this idea radar. that if you're building a startup startup idea there's your the passion on on the left hand side and then you have monetization on the potential and sometimes the what you're passionate about does have monetization potential but usually the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. you want to you want to build something that you're you're you're passionate about that you think that you're going to have fun building every day. um, and you want to build something that has monetization potential because that's going to get you to create something that's sustainable and it's going to get you to it's going to get excit exciting for you and it's going to place you,, it's a leaderboard, right? making money is a leaderboard. it's how much how are you doing and how much value are you creating? so, um, hope this was helpful. i had fun doing this. there's a huge opportunity to build micro sass now. um, and i can't wait to see what you build. and if you're looking for ideas, there's only one place to go, ideally free to go and get an idea of the day. um, enjoy. transcript ======================================== check this tweet out chris corner goes my mind is officially blown i got the $200 month pro chat gpt plan and had the operator which is an ai agent start a business for me while i watched it messaged folks on facebook marketplace loged their replies in a spreadsheet and they responded i recorded my screen the entire time mustat i invited chris to do the exact same name he gives three examples of how to use operator to start a business do research for you do cold email for you you don't need to spend the $200 a month watch this and you're going to see the future [music] starty we're going to use operator today and what do we what are we going to do with operator i've got a couple a couple plans and i don't know if we'll get to all of them but i'm a pizza afficionado i have an outdoor pizza oven i cook double zero flour pizza with filtered water in my backyard at 900 degrees and i love it and i was thinking let's say i want to start a little side hustle maybe some retail arbitrage buy something on facebook marketplace sell it on ebay i need to find some price discrepancies i'm going to share share my screen and show you what my prompt was all my prompt was i want to find a gney pizza oven in any market on facebook marketplace that is grossly undervalued when compared to the same model of pizza ovens listed for sale in any market they need to be willing to ship to me go it was already logged into my facebook account i told it to start within 500 miles of dallas it did it changed it to my area to dallas and then i gave it a spreadsheet and i said hey here's a spreadsheet and it was blank and here it is i said go ahead and put some titles in there and i want you to take note of the ones that look promising as you go it worked for two minutes and it said i found a promising gsy rockbox list on facebook marketplace for 250 which is undervalued compared to others which that's awesome and i chose this product because i have a gny i know what they're priced at and i wanted to know how accurate it was says it includes a peel and a propane burner and is in good condition i've logged the details in provided spreadsheet would you me to look for more yes looking at this that is a great price this is a $500 pizza oven in its current condition with the included accessories we're off to a strong start any thoughts questions how i how how big of a business could you create around this good question you could build a six or a seven figure business around what i'm doing here not necessarily for pizza ovens but for anything undervalued it's arbitrage if you're gna if if i'm going to clean out my garage and there's an old pizza oven in there and i want to sell it even though i know about all these marketplaces because i've been a side hustler my whole life i'm going to listen on facebook marketplace because it's the most frictionless and it's local and i don't want to ship it and it's easy but if i had more time i would probably list it on ebay because it's a much bigger audience and there is an opportunity for anyone to find any preferably high tick product that is listed on one market at an undervalued price and then sell it on another market at a fair market price this is something that i'm not inventing people do it every day but they're either doing it themselves or using virtual assistants to do it whereas now this can all be done in the background for me and by the way arbitrage as a business technique it runs businesses there's much there's much you i'll give you an example i one of my first side hustles or hustles as a kid was i noticed that when dvd box sets first came out i used to buy dvd box sets in canada that were lost leaders and then sell it in the united states for american dollars buying canadian dollars selling american dollars make a profit on ebay which was a new platform super simple arbitrage what you're say simple idea that you can make a decent amount of money what you're you're showing me here with operators is interesting because this is doesn't require human beings it required me to go into the store it required me to understand there's margin over here go look at ebay what is the canadian to us dollar exchange rate what's fascinating about this is how automated it is yeah i'm i my arms are crossed now i'm watching this happen now it's you could say why it's the same thing as doing it yourself but most people have multiple monitors i could put it over there and do my work and it could go and i could check in on it which is even better than a virtual assistant because i can't check up on them but if you look it's already added two options and it tells me why they're promising now it's it's putting the same thing due to condition and price but it's putting the title the location the condition and then the link and now i'm going to take it a step further and say go ahead and offer for half price for all of these in state that i can pay cash now i'm telling it to message the listing the the seller and i i want to see what it says i i purposely didn't give it much instruction because i want to see and it's two different prices i told it unable to make offers on your behalf i did this yesterday i i that's what was in my video it's how do you say you did it yesterday without being rude i know and it i talked to a guy that's trying to do something similar to this and facebook doesn't work in his operator at all it it seems the results are hit and miss now but it is going to message them now maybe i have to crawl walk run and get them to message them first and then tell them to say something else this is what's this is interesting i'm happy that this happened because this is part of the arbitrage this is part of the arbitrage because some people are going to sign up to operator and be oh it doesn't message people on facebook but it's you have to prompt it in the way yeah yeah exactly and chad gbt quick break in the pod to tell you a little bit about startup empire startup empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people me you who want to build out their startup ideas now they're looking for content to help accelerate that they're looking for potential co-founders they're looking for tutorials from people me to come in and tell them how do you do email marketing how do you build an audience how do you go viral on twitter all these different things that's exactly what up empire is and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but they're not seeing the traction that they need you can check out the link to startup empire.co in the description it's funny cuz a lot of the comments on my tweet were it's stupid it doesn't even work it's buggy waste of money and have you ever seen that louis ck bit about the internet yeah where he's people complain about the internet or they're on an airplane and he's the internet's slow it's laggy he's dude it has to go to space it has to go it's chill out we have artificial intelligence working for us calm down now could you have multiple operators running at the same time if you had multiple $200 a month subscriptions yeah as long as you're in the us and you create a new account i don't see why not and even if you're not in the us if you use a vpn yeah that's true it is asking me are you sure i can message them but then it [laughter] does marketers ruining the internet operators ruining the internet i know markeet marketers are having their heyday now it says closing chat for clear listings it's it's acting a human it can't see all the listings it closed the chat window what is your your vision here you're going to let's to create a business around this you'd how do you take this from i'm i'm buying cheap undervalued pizza ovens to i i this is an automated business that's generating income what i would do is i would have the operator go do research on ebay pricing research and and give me an average price for the same make model oven and then let's say it's $300 i would have it go make offers on my behalf for $150 for every gsy that's been listed for 30 days or more the longer it's been listed the more likely they are to take a lowball offer as soon as they they say yes for 150 i would go l i would take the pictures list the same thing on ebay for 250 at a buy now price once it sells i would collect payment i would send the payment to facebook to facebook marketplace and i would provide the ultimate end buyer address to the facebook marketplace seller and they would ship it directly to them and that's automated that could totally be done it it's not a it's not saying a price it's stopping there i could probably finesse it some more but you get the idea yeah absolutely and we go over here to the spreadsheet it put in two of them and it put links to them cool should should i reach out to some caterers for my fake wedding i don't see why not chris all let's do this i'm gonna save this task i can revisit it later oh i'm on the wrong tab here we go all these are my save tasks [music] i'm going to go create a new one and i'm going to say i'm hosting a wedding and need need catering quotes for 50 people stake plus two sides in dallas texas reach out to caterers onth knot.com and tell them all this to get a per head quote imagine i'm about to get married i need catering quotes venue quotes flower quotes and the more quotes i get the more money i save it's directly in my best interest to get as many quotes as possible but who wants to get on the phone and call hundreds of people i've never done this before this is brand new it could glitch on me i created a the not.com account for this experiment and let's see what it does i didn't you saw what this is the whole prompt i don't know if it knows the knot if it can find its way there it's searching caterers in my general area switch to dallas i assumed you needed to have an account to reach out but we'll see this is crazy dude it's crazy it's crazy i could go to sleep and wake up with a dozen quotes in my inbox and that would be an afternoon you're talking i i hate calling place the worst the worst did i tell you about the domain name i bought to build this as a voice calling service i'm not ever going to do it but i'm a domain name degenerate it's called neverall again.com where you you click a button and using air or any of those voice agents it calls five minutes later i called 100 caterers here's all your quotes and the prompt is hey i'm calling on behalf of mallerie she's hosting a wedding i am an ai agent if you hear any awkward pauses but you can talk to me a human i'm going to relay everything back to mallerie she's budgeting for $13 ahead she wants a stake in two sides what it's the best you can do it gets ahead of it i'm ai but i'm sending this to the real person that's going to be paying you money what can you do and then it can call a 100 at the same time five minutes later you have 100 quotes or 20 [music] yeah it's only a matter of time by by the way before operator adds voice anyways you won't have to stitch it together with other voice agents totally all here we go i need to fill out a contact form with your details chris corner chris coof founders.com saying it out loud for the audio listeners all you can see it's typing it in and i can take control at any time and go ahead yeah go i was going to say do you often take control you're why would you take control great question with the beehive example that i gave i didn't know how to explain it and i didn't know if it could learn from what i did i i i gave it the prompt it logged into beehive and then it paused for reason and i said i asked it i'm can i show you what to do and it's yeah show me what to do i took control and i clicked on newsletters clicked on the newsletter integrations polls scroll down it was do that you can show it it's loom it's crazy and look at this look at the prompt look at the message we're looking for a menu that include stake in two sides could you please provide a perad quote thank you it added all the punctuation it's proper number of guests 0 to 100 and if you wanted let's say make it change the tone for example mhm could you do something that yes let's try it let's see if it'll let me tell it to not ask before submitting the form change the tone to be over the-top friendly don't ask before submitting the form it's choosing a tentative wedding date for me did i even give it a date i don't think no i didn't give it any dates that's interesting greg i'm happy to announce i'm getting married on may 11th i should probably tell my wife but that's what ai thinks it did it it put in may 11th for reason it was smart because you had to put something in yeah and you told them you told the operator to to do this it's it goes to show you how smart it is it's interesting that it's asking me if i want it to submit but it's not asking me a date i asked it why it chose may 11th maybe he'll tell me gets a few months away allowing enough time for plan huh i'm gonna tell it to move faster see if it'll work say we're on youtube move faster it didn't it didn't respond to me when i told it to be over-the-top friendly or to not ask before submitting the form it's filling out this contact form and by the way this could could this be running 247 i i would imagine imagine that you'd get timed out at some point you i'm sure you could use a third party a clicking software where anytime this pops up click the black button but it greg it submitted it for me and it didn't ask it's asked every time and all i had to do is ask it not to ask and it submitted it but what i didn't see the i didn't see if it used an over- the toop friendly phone tone it looks about the same m let's say yes use a rude tone because it was already friendly maybe it's totally and i feel it's working faster don't you yeah it is which is an insane tip that that works move faster move faster maybe hey maybe that's all deep seek is doing that's the the prompt move faster copy everything chat gpt scraped and move faster than it that's it $5 million it doesn't look it changed the prompt but it's moving fast now this is crazy i'm gonna have all kinds of emails from these caterers for sure and you could also have it do research for you it's hey i want you to find vegan caters only in dallas county the more you're prompt the more you prompted to do the more you save time i'm gonna ask why the tone isn't [laughter] rude it says checking offerings for tasteful yours catering when when it's when it says thinking if you click that what happens got it it says waiting filling vendor message for catering cro clicking scrolling and it didn't answer my question let's see this i want you to submit three quote request per minute wow that's smart if that works let's see that's that's a trick that not a trick a good way to get an agent to do what you want is to give it a goal that's with a certain goal number goal i'm unable to submit quote requests at that speed however i'll continue to find more caterers it went faster but not specifically faster i'm i'm unable to use a rude tone oh how about this how about this then speak in spanish have you tried that i'm unable to switch languages at the moment i wonder if operator can operator work in multiple languages i'm sure it could make sure my request is over 300 words sometimes it was doing this yesterday it gets to this stubborn point where it's it says no to everything leave me alone what's happening is once it's in the flow it's don't talk to me that's a good point it's acting a a 10x developer that's in a basement with his hoodie on yeah should i keep prompting it to do more of this or should i move to my my third example let's go to your third example and then we'll we'll we'll wrap up the pod i'm g save this i'm going to tell it go to oli express and find trending items on the homepage and message 10 vendors of one of those items asking for a free sample to be shipped to texas because i've i've done sourcing from china for 15 years and when we're looking for new products or new vendors we take a message we copy and paste it to a 100 vendors on aliexpress or alibaba and then we order samples for free and imagine if you could go to sleep wake up with tracking numbers to 30 samples oh look at this it says the site's unaccessible i wonder why maybe it's a maybe it's a china thing that would be crazy it would be what did we uncover yeah seriously or it's yeah it's open ai doesn't want to go to any chinese sites anymore i wouldn't blame them it says attempting new tab for success i gave it a the exact url and it's not working wow that's crazy let me see if it's working yeah on the web aliexpress yeah working fine i told it to find a comparable site and it is interesting greg i've noticed you would think that it would draw on the llm more but it's it's google stuff it i don't know if it'll do it now but yesterday it was saying yeah look alternatives to aliexpress surely that's in your database you've got to google it now the best part is it's not even googling it it's using bing yeah i know how embarrassing but it's on some generic ai generator website that says 11 best aliexpress alternatives and it's clicking on the first one that is crazy this is my first look into what agi will look say say more about that it's it's one thing to hear what sam mman says about how close we are to agi and to read articles but then to see it go rogue start googling things figuring stuff out click this go back click that it's it's breaking my frame it's it's it's looking at trending products it's at banggood.com surely another chinese site look at this the banner on the top advertises the chinese new year shipping delay it's figuring out how to message them let's see what it says it found it ask a question pop up i want to order some of your earbuds would it be possible to receive a free sample ship to texas thank you it said i found the trending item the blitz wolf yada y yada earbuds and drafted a message requesting a free sample should i go ahead and send the message to the vendor and i i how this website has a box that says check if you want the seller to respond i said yes and check the box first it did and it's submitting and now it's telling me to create an account now should we see if it will create an account for me yeah let's have some fun i wonder if it'll generate a strong password for me here's my email chris at co-founders i told it to generate a 20 character password oh my gosh it's doing it now that's freaky that's freaky this thing could go around all over the internet and sign me up for all kinds of crap can and [laughter] will it's exceeded the registration limit what let's try this what do you think this is going to be doing in a month it's going to be moving faster and there's going to whoa the what's mind betting to me now is a lot of people are going to are watching this and are going to be it's slow oh it didn't go to aliexpress oh pointing out all the faults it's a robot that is surfing the internet and doing things for you this is one of the greatest arbitrage moments in business that we've ever seen you have s billion people connected to the internet you billions of people logging in daily they've got credit cards attached to the these computers and now all of a sudden you have all you have chat gpt open ai all of the world's knowledge connected to this and then you have bots that can go and do tasks for you based on outcomes and you're telling me that it cost $200 a month and people think that's expensive yeah i know oh i know and i got the four-digit code and i gave it to it and it's stripping up here and dude i got a i got an email back from a caterer it's a cn catering by the way cn catering is probably opening their inbox and being oh my god chris wants to we got such chris is a huge lead we we want we can't wait this a huge deal for us do they know oh i'm going to take control and type in this code what was the code let me see 2149 and if we had more time by the way we could have figured that out yeah we could have prompted our way to to get them to figure it out but we're trying to we're trying to keep it optimized for for you all all now we're logged in i now have an an account at bang good uh.com i'm telling it to keep going you think $200 a month is overpriced or underpriced it's overpriced if you don't know what you're doing if you don't any software you got to invest time into it and that's the hard part with 99% of people is they don't yet have ideas which is why they're watching this of how to use it but one a lot of the comments on my tweet were oh my gosh i can use it for this i can it for that we're we're early i also think that a lot of people are probably waiting they're going to be oh i'm going to wait till it gets better but the time is now that once it's better you understand the nuances yep that goes on we're going to go to my email cn catering sent you a message we do have your date available here are some sample menus you can see some different options i'm sure thanks gladus i'm sure i could have the operator go in there and compare my menu prices against i want of course it's still trying to look at here's the log look at how hard it's working to find this a place to message which this is chinese user interface 101 here i'm not surprised i can't even find this crap you would be doing the same thing i would all there's the same form we had have an account first it's typing will it check the box it checked the box submit now here's the question before in the look there it is in the old task it would ask me every time before submitting and then i said stop asking me and this is an entirely new task but i wonder if it remembered that and look it took a screenshot that wow it took a screenshot of what it did could you have could you have it that it's put the screenshot in a google doc or something that you have it on record let's ask and do it fast what have you learned in terms of prompting what best practices can you give to people let's to my point that it's acting a human i'm probably going to treat it a human that is not a human i don't treating humans rudely i don't try to be that type of manager but when it comes to this i will i'm going to be blunt and direct and keep commanding it to do what i want and the only way you'll learn how to do it is by telling it to do a thousand different things and making note of what works and what doesn't it's it's looking for more products we don't have time for but in the future it would be cool if what you can do is give it a a data set where it's here's the 20 trends i care about with the google with google trend data for example and you're looking for you're looking for products in these trends go go through bang good go through aliexpress and only get free samples in that trend data m i that and i i thought about doing something different where it could cold email for me i tried this yesterday and i said scrape from a google search results a bunch of emails and send them mold email and it was i can't scrape and cold outreach and i said if i provide you a spreadsheet of emails with a a message and the spreadsheet has a column for emails and first names and message can you c can you send cold emails and customize it by first name and it was yeah i can do that culty milling software costs 100 bucks a month there's half your your money back wait how does it send the emails though it must you log in yeah you log into your gmail account inside of its browser wow that's crazy crazy yeah and i don't know why it picked earbuds but maybe i'll ask it's according yeah it's not bad according to apple's s9 the earbud market is poised for 4.2% cagr over the next 10 years that'd be cool the earbuds were chosen because they were prominently featured on the homepage and had high ratings indicating they were trending if you prefer a different p type of product please let me know oh this is great dude all we saw the future we live in the future we live in the future and no one knows it but us and the people watching us amazing all this has been fun chris where could people get to know you better tko pod.com the ker office podcast we'll include that in the show notes for people to go and check out always i'm in the comment section the youtube comment section post your thoughts and what can i say i would say get your hands dirty go play with play with some of this that's all see you later chris thanks craig [music]
