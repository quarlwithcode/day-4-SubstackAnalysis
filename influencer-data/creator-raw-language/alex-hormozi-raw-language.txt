transcript ======================================== what i want to do is show you how to win and impress the only person that matters which is future you not the person next to you not the person in front of you not the person on stage not your mom future you the point of this presentation is to give you a different way to think about this process you can make it easier to win and the nice thing is is that the process i'm going to show you is how you can win at anything and it works for winning at health relationships advertising sales real estate business investing in anything else where you have to do things to get stuff cool awesome all with that being said let's begin how to win i'm going to cover five things what to do how to do it why to do it who you need to become to do it then finally when to start let's start with number one said simply what do you need to do to win aka impress the future version of you and the reason i define winning this way is that for those of you guys who are at the top and you guys know who you are you can't compare yourself to everyone that you're already better than and i say that from a success objective measurement perspective not as a human being everyone's a wonderful snowflake but you can't compare yourself to people that you're beating because you'll get complacent that for those you guys who are the winners here for those you guys not at the top or who are on the climb you can only control what you can control and you only know what that is and there might be advantages or disadvantages that you might have been born with it also doesn't matter no one cares the only people who excuses are the ones giving them and let's start with an activity to prove to you that you already know what not to do this is a process i call verion and i use this a hilarious amount probably too much and this at least i will attribute this to albert einstein charlie merer talks about it a lot invert always invert when you have a tough problem and i use this and we use this as a as a strong tool because it's easier for our brains to find problems and solutions we had to think earlier now let's think of things for gratitude did anyone for a split second be [ __ ] anyone anyone else do that cuz i heard it backstage and i was you're about to be on stage that you could be grateful for that i was thinking about that but but if i said hey can you think of a problem i could be i can give you 20 now off the top of my head is my my knee hurts a little bit i can start giving you problems easily but that's because we're programmed to survive not thrive our brains are programmed to find threats to make sure we live to see another day not that we enjoy to day and we have much stronger problem finding skills than solution finding and what i want to do is use our anxiety-driven threat finding brain for something good and here's the activity i want you to imagine the least successful version of you loser what does that person do or not do to guarantee that you won't win how do they guarantee that you lose all shout some of these out what does that person do to lose netflix i heard that one drugs drugs we're going way deeper and darker than i was thinking he's a heroin addiction i'm yes understood i thought you guys were going to say something [laughter] [applause] this being impatient show up late be unprepared not confident hair heroin we can throw that up there being transactional rather than relational with your clients and customers don't follow up someone's hey i've been thinking about selling my house and you're awesome and then you never call them i've got a friend who might be interested in your services and you're that's a damn shame don't advertise don't ask for referrals these are probably some things that would guarantee that you won't be successful and there's probably more we could add this list and i would encourage you though if you think about this to put these things down because this is genuinely the process that about when i want to grow a business when i want to get into a new endeavor how could i guarantee that i would lose what would i in the fewest moves i could possibly make what are the fewest things i could do to absolutely guarantee that i lose and the smaller the list you can make the more potent those things are if there's one thing that you can do to guarantee that you lose that usually becomes the north star of how you win how do we use these things that our brains came up with to win we invert it we flip it and this is what that would look from patient goes to sorry impatient goes to patient showing late is to always being on time being unprepared to being always prepared or overprepared not confident to confident transactional to relational doesn't follow up to always follows up to doesn't advertise to advertises constantly to not asking for referrals to always doing quick story on this one of our companies had one sales guy who was outperforming the previous top salesperson by 2x and i wanted to know what this guy was doing i hopped on the phone which he was and i was what are you doing man and he's after i sell someone i asked if they want to bring somebody else and i was yeah and then i looked at the sales director i was is that not in the [ __ ] script already he's no no it is and i was why are we not enforcing it he was we we are now and simple [ __ ] and a lot of you guys already know how to win because how to lose flip it after all that everybody here does know what to do to win but maybe you don't know how to do it let's talk about that most times we don't know we don't do things because we haven't broen them down to the most basic form all the more skilled you are the more general a command can be and you can follow it someone can go shiron can be hey you want to jv on this company with me and he'd be can you grow it and i would say sure general command can you grow this business sure if you go to a toddler and say grow this business they're going to be what does that mean but is that we're not dissimilar for from toddlers it's that our egos grew up but not our abilities and you might say to the ceo go advertise the less skilled you are the more broken down the command must be in order to follow it if i were to tell the toddler genuinely how to grow the business it might start with hit the button then wait until the light comes on then click the blue circle then type in facebook.com hit enter you guys catching this what's the difference the level of detail in the instructions and this is why two people can go through the same training or event and get wildly different results results come down to the number of skills the person has and the number of skills required to understand and execute this is how learning happens skills for winter coming into this event today might be they already know how to email market they already have charisma they know how to speak they they know how to follow up they have these skills the other person here might have no skills and they could attend this event and then nothing would happen was it the event or was it the person it's that there are requisites in college you've got requisites to do something you have to have former skills to advance to the next level and unfortunately and this applies to those of you who have teams and if you are a teammate you can think about this in reverse if you have one broken link in the chain of commands or instruction that someone does not understand they get stuck and then they do not complete the task and you're why are you incompetent and it might be because they don't understand one step and for example let's say that you need you hear go advertise skilled guy says on it the less skilled person says but how now compare that to turn on your computer do you think everybody in your team can do that that means that everybody here here can be successful if you break it down to a level that you cannot fail that you understand every step does that make sense that i can do you need to break things down to their most basic level that everyone can learn them and when you do that you make it easier for more skilled people and you make it possible for less skilled people and for example i said earlier on purpose be more charismatic can we agree that if someone's more charismatic they might do better in this field in general yeah cool what does that mean it means smile when people walk in change emphasis and tality when you're talking remember people's names ask people about themselves nod multiple times and then respond when people are talking keep eye contact address everyone in the room when you enter and exit we might then say that person's charismatic but if someone says to you be charismatic you might be but if someone said do these six things do you think you could do that yes you have to break it down and the this is the essence of good teaching and training and learning how to learn will make you better at teaching yourself and then by extension your team here's the writer downer if you can learn it it is a skill and if it's a skill you can teach it which is why i wholeheartedly reject the concept of people being born a certain way they might have physical attributes that orient the environment to reinforce certain behaviors but if they became that way they were taught to be that way either formally or informally but they learned that because it was reinforced at some part in their lives which means now if you're i'm not naturally charismatic neither are children they learn and if you can pock your ego you can too which means that these traits everyone says the best are born with are simply buckets of smaller skills that we group together into a single larger term to save time when we're communicating we we don't say hey johnny's such a good realtor because he smiles when everyone walks in the door he remembers everyone's name he changes his tonality when when he speaks he's he he always addresses everyone ins inside and out when he enters and exits we don't say that we say he's charismatic but that shorthand in language is a source of confusion and remember at the beginning i said this is going to be mr miyagi thing don't worry it'll come back and is we know how to teach toddlers but it's also how adults learn our egos are too sensitive to allow it and what i want you to do is operationalize the list of actions that we figured out together earlier we had this big list of all the ways that you can lose we flip those into how we can win and then we take those words be patient be charismatic always be on time we say how do i operationalize that what do i do turn on the button turn the computer on hit enter how do we do that and if you're what does operationalize mean explain using actions or behaviors you can see with your eyes someone being charismatic i can't see with my eyes did they smile when they walked in the door i can observe that did they call someone by their name i can observe that did they the other things on my list were no it's not feelings thoughts intentions impressions manifestations affirmations or psychology none of those things belong in instructions why because you have no idea what anyone else is thinking all we know is that as a group when people follow this process more people buy and here's the cool part that's all we need to know we don't need to test the science of the psychology we know that when we greet people we look them in the eyes we shake them we remember their hand and then we and then we follow up on this cadence it works that's it it's all we needed to know and then do it and we know that if we do these things you get this outcome and that makes learning and teaching a lot simpler we deal with only what we can measure and observe and i promise you if you can look at the world this way one 90% of the content you in your newsfeed you will be able to ignore his noise cuz people are it's the manifestation of the internal trauma from child smile and shake their [ __ ] hand stop stop stop let me give you another example and this is one that i struggled with i i spent a lot of my time trying to operationalize words because it helps me understand the world better because i don't feel i understand much at all and that's and i share that stuff in my content because i share the stuff as i figure it out or at least as i figure it out for me and i have always been somebody who identified as being an impatient person and i figured if i was going to be an investor patience would probably be a important character trait to have and i was what how do i do that if someone's be patient you're now what what does that mean patience means figuring out what to do in the meantime that's it aka doing anything besides doing the thing you're avoiding including doing nothing at all this is why some of these dictionary definitions are difficult to do anything with it's not the capacity to accept or tolerate delay trouble suffering without getting angry or upset figure out what to do in the meantime that's being patient quick question who here has investments this isn't a big flex question cool now now provided you aren't on robin hood selling your [ __ ] you are being patient by being here now your investments are moving in one direction or another and you're being patient because you figured out something to do in the meantime huh not hard in other words yeah i wrote this there we go which brings me to my next howo binaries and continuums real quick if you it's not that you are patient or not and the reason i'm emphasizing this is because sometimes it can feel unrealistic to trying to team these traits it's it's hard for me to be charismatic or not softspoken or patient but it's not about being it or not being it the question is how patient are you which means that it's not a binary it's a continuum it's can i move myself slowly in this direction by taking actions all which makes every skill you work on improvable and every do everything that we do to impress our future selves is another proof point that we act more times than not in this way until eventually we begin to describe ourselves as patient or detail oriented or charismatic and this allows us to see progress with these quote traits which are buckets of larger skills that we do shorthand with we can communicate and now that we covered that i can finally define three terms that will matter for everyone in this room and cement the how learning intelligence and confidence let's start with learning learning simply means same condition new behavior the same thing happens and then you respond differently that's learning if i show you a red card and then i slap you wow that sucked and i put it back in my pocket and then i bring out my red card again and then i slap you then i bring out my my red card again you duck you learned the phone rings hello no script phone rings hi phone rings read the script you learned same condition new behavior learning please remember this because i'm going to hit on this multiple times throughout learning means same condition to behavior if you're presented with the same situation and you do not change how you behave you have not learned that's learning intelligence how fast you change what you do in the same situation intelligence is rate of learning speed of learning dumber phone rings no script phone rings no script phone rings no script never changes dumber liing how complex this is smarter phone rings no script phone rings read script changes faster smarter everyone wants to think they're smart but many of you will leave this event go back to the same environment and not change your behavior if that's you which one of these two are you below dumber everyone's or [music] smarter you may not have ever thought that you were smart but if you change your behavior you can beat even the quote smartest person which is why you need to be delta you need to be a triangle change instead of an l7 weeny a square that's why triangles win because we change that's intelligence which is simply rate of learning how quickly you change your behavior under the same conditions how can we tie that to confidence cuz could we agree that a realtor who's more confident would probably do better in this field than one who isn't awesome the percentage likelihood that's something happens in statistics you have a confidence metric how confident we are are we that something's going to happen and confidence is domain specific you can be a confident realtor and a not confident parent interesting how do you increase your confidence percentage with proof how do you create proof you do it a lot of times and how can you make sure you have a high percentage likelihood that the script comes out the way you want it with a client you do it in the exact situation a lot of times because confidence is domain specific there's some people who practice their speech in the mirror but when they get on stage they freeze they're but i practiced this thing you didn't practice in front of a crowd it becomes domain specific you sound certain here's how you do that do it enough times that you get bored of it you can complete the sentences you can do it while you're driving you can do it in any situation you want because guess what that's when you'll be performing the script here's a writer downer confidence comes from the past not the present if your plan requires luck it's a bad plan if you need to get lucky in order to win in this game you will not win you can prepare and you do that in the past before you need the skill you dig the before you're thirsty now that we covered the what you guys all know the big list of things that you should be doing and you can break it down into an operationalized little basic nugget of i can do this with the how let's talk about why you should but aren't i'm going to talk about two things within my little y category external conditions and internal conditions i'll start here that's supposed to be the economy i i don't know if that the little visual looks economic but i liked it here's why you might not be doing it i call this the five stages of opportunity hopping you go from step one uninformed optimism you're man in this low interest rate environment my cousin's making a killing in real estate must be amazing i could do that too then you hop in you go to step two which is informed pessimism huh this is not as easy as i originally thought people aren't coming to give me their homes to sell g goly and then you keep going you keep going and you reach this third point where you're the valley of despair what is life is this what i want to do am i passionate about real estate i do love being a family person i and then you start justifying reasons not to do something and this is what most people do is they get to the valley of despair and then they jump because in the beginning there you saw your cousin who doing at real and you're i'm going to jump in but you were doing something before that that you were in the valy to spare of that thing and all you do is or not you but all many people do is that they uninformed optimism informed pessimism value of despair uninformed optimism informed pessimism value of despair uninformed optimism if it sounds repetitive some of you have lived this thing 10 [ __ ] times and many of you guys are here now it's a tougher climate than it was 24 months ago but here's what it looks when it's you go to stage four which is informed optimism which is what there is a process that when i got into this i didn't understand but now i do understand it and i've broken it down into into actions that i can do and perform on a regular basis and i have a feedback cycle that i can learn how to get better and i will measure myself on the progress that i do to the things that i've committed to i know how to win and then you do that stuff and you get to step five which is you win and then you question why life is meaningless to begin with but we'll get to that later we get more for what we put in when we stick with things you get compounding returns when you stick with things longer and wealth is made during the hard times because because the largest percentage of the market transfers to the few left standing that guy work out the more you do anything the better you get at it and the more environments you do it in the better you get at it in more environments especially considering a macre environment now the question is who would you trust more to sell your house the agent who's been through three recessions and never left the profession rhym didn't mean to do that but sounds that's cool or the agent who juggles three opportunities and hops in and out when it's convenient oh some of you were that's me and you wonder why you don't win and your clients feel that way too and even if the people who see you now aren't in the market they're always deciding who they're going to go with when they do and people including future you will be watching what you do and how you you act and you need to do three times the work for the same outcome today but 10 times the eyes are on you and if you close deals when times are hard they'll know you can close their deal when times are easy tldr down times is when champions are made it's when skills are sharpened if you can win now when the economy turn turns around you will crush i love this quote a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor who here to be [ __ ] great then we should [ __ ] wish for storms because if you want to be a skilled sailor then you need you cannot be great unless you have something to test yourself against you can't claim that you were loyal until someone if you're married if until somebody comes up to you and you say i'm good you can claim loyalty all day but until you test it you don't have the skill because you have no proof today these times are are opportunities to give our ourselves proof of who we are and that is one of the most motivating things of hard times is that these are the stories that you will someday tell about yourself here's the writer down what makes you extraordinary isn't what you do it's how long you're willing to do it for there's nothing extraordinary about saying someone's name and shaking their hand it's great but is it extraordinary i don't know but if you do it every single time for the rest of your life is that extraordinary something as simple as that that yes it is it's not what you do it's how long you're willing to do it for and i said i was going to talk about two things external conditions did that now i'm going to talk about this internal conditions for why you're not doing something that you should be doing where does motivation come from i don't know childhood trauma i didn't get hugged enough motivation comes from deprivation let going to get dark for a second it'll be fun this person for example is motivated to breathe you going to agree on that next point unmotivated to have sex they might be who knows some of you guys are wild all i don't want to breathe all calm down don't worry i'm moving on i know that yeah yeah i'm moving on i'm moving on let me explain when are you more motivated to eat drink water sleep when you're hungry thirsty and tired that's when you're the most motivated have you ever finished a big meal and been man i could go for another pizza probably not have you drank a big gallon of water and been i don't want any more fluids of course not because you're not deprived and when you're full you don't want it anymore after you finish thanksgiving to dessert you're stuffed are you still hungry no have you drink a bunch of water do you want more no what does this have to do with motivation to win and make money i told you i'll wrap it i i'll move it because by this logic wouldn't all poor people be motivated since they're deprived of money that would make sense but we know that's not the case because the people who make the most money are the ones who keep wanting to make more huh here's why when you're tired hungry hry or thirsty you perceive a gap and your motivation is proportional to your deprivation how much you don't have hung this guy is much hungrier than the person who's maybe i'll have dinner on the way home and here's why money motivation is more complicated than hunger or thirst or being sleepy with money deprivation is not physiological it's psychological you only feel poor if you perceive a large gap between where you are and where you want to be let me show you this visually let's say you're at $5,000 a month in income and your desire is to get to $10,000 a month fair enough cool now let's say this guy is doing a million a month in income but he wants to get to 10 million a month in income relative to their goal one guy is closer he's only half of his goal the other guy's one tenth of his goal who's more deprived huh hang around five people with 10 times the net worth that you have and you'll feel poorer than you ever did when you were poor around poorer people than you that'll be a horos family tongue twister for my children aka changing your minimum standard which i stole from shon the number one predictor of wealth is an iq gender race and this one startled me it's the zip code you're born in [ __ ] with you a little bit you're huh it's not about race it's not about gender it's not even about iq it's where you're born which means it's the things that we compare ourselves to because your environment sets your standards if you change the environment you change your behavior this is why networks this are valuable you can get someone to do anything if you orient the en arm in the way i can get everyone here to take off their clothes if i make this 150° in this room i could you could if you change the environment you can change behavior if i told you to to hey everybody get naked be i'm good alex fair enough crank this thing to 150 people start stripping i didn't need to say anything the environment changed your behavior more than i ever could this is why the places this and networks this are valuable and if you want to feel more motivated change who you compare yourself to our environment stretches the gap and you experience the deprivation rich people are more deprived of money than poor people because they compare themselves to richer people than poor people do and consider this extreme example you've got the guy with a bag on his back nothing else he needs i have everything i need two i need everything who's more deprived you might be huh this seems dark is there a clean way to make this comparison without focusing on other people because that's what i would be asking yes compare yourself to the person you generally want to become that's how you can create the gap here's the writer downer if you want to change what you do change who you compare yourself to we covered external conditions that might be stopping you from the doing the what opportunity hopping and sticking it out and now we cover the internal conditions that might have preventing been preventing you who you compare yourself to and your internal levels of motivation and deprivation now that we covered the what and we covered the how we covered the why internal and external now let's talk about who you have to become to do that how do we become someone with certain traits contrary to popular opinion and the instagram people i don't think it has to be do with becoming at all when we describe who someone is what do we do we describe how they behave and what they do being and identities become descriptions of what we do and little aristotle little ancient greek we are what we repeatedly do and that's why this whole thing that has been popularized by the the the the fluff people hopefully no one else said this earlier on this stage that would suck b do have is bs let me explain we describe someone identity we say hey he's honest he's hardworking he's a real estate agent that's how we describe them let's translate those he's honest he states the facts he's hardworking you complete tasks as fast or faster than expectations you agree to there a real estate agent someone who represents buyers and or sellers in real estate transactions all that's the identity but everything that we use to describe the identity are things the person does note that being has 100% to do with doing if you want to be a certain type of person then you need to do what that certain type of person does and when you do those certain things then you get the results of those actions which means you can summarize the entire thing of b do have to do cuz by doing you be and by doing you get do this makes the person that you want to become the actions you take that we later describe as identity 100% under your control which is inspiring which is why one of my favorite sayings of all time is here's a writer downer the work works on you more than you work on it and i'll tell you a little story i was at sephora with my wife it's a makeup store it's where they sell paint for ladies anyways we're there and i'm standing against the wall this and lila's doing and i see these two little girls super excited and the lady in the smok comes up to them and she's this is eyeliner and this is lipstick i learned those terms and you need to start budging for this now cuz they they're probably this height is agewise and they were excited and they're because now that you're grown up and your guys are women you have to start budgeting for this every month because you need to start spending it and i thought it was such a cute little story and the girls were excited but she said that with a new identity comes new priorities you're going to shift how you allocate resources based on the person you want to become these girls want to become women and she said great you need to change how behave and for many of you being number one in winning simply comes down to doing what the number one person does or would do or the number one version of yourself and then if you do those things people will eventually describe you that way when the evidence catches up we talked about now we've talked about who you have to become which is a reminder of doing what future version of you does for a long enough period that you would describe yourself that way all finally let's talk about the when you should start when do you start this stuff because you might be what alex this all sounds great the little hand thing with the fingers cool but i'm busy now it's not a good time maybe in the future let's put it up there there's three things about time that i find interesting you can have a reason not to do something because season-wise economically or timing in the season of your life isn't good we can think about hour by hour you're i don't have the time in the day to get this stuff done that would make me number one or you can use something that i to call the when then fallacy let's break it down if you're busy that's the best time to change your behavior why because you guys want this to last if you're going to change your behavior you want your behavior change to last correct then if you only wait until you're not busy then you assume that you will be not busy again in the future because if it's contingent on you being not busy then the moment you get busy again you'll stop start when you're the busiest that when you get busy again you already know how to do it and that you can stick with it does that make sense cool did anyone get one of their reasons crushed great if you're waiting till you're less busy to start a new habit or program it assumes that you get busy again you'll stop if you want enduring change the best time to start is when you're busy learn how to make it work in the worst condition and it'll stick in the best now is the best time let's go hour by hour i used to say the same thing to my wife of i don't have time to do all these things and what she did she grabbed my phone she looked at my time usage and she was huh here's four hours every day you spend on not work i found you some time anyone want to look at their phone now probably not the other way to think about this is do you think that there's someone on earth who had less make it happen yes of course if they can you can too everyone is the same 24 hours it's about how you allocate them and the nice thing is is that if you're doing a lot of stuff now and you're not getting to where you want to go you're doing the wrong stuff and the first thing when you when you course correct is elimination not addition cuz most of stuff you're doing now is not working then change what you do and you'll have way more time smart busy broke can't be all three you got to pick two you can be smart and busy but you won't be broke you can be busy and broke but you're not smart you can be smart and broke but you're not busy super real talk if you're working all the time and you're not making progress you're doing the wrong stuff people who achieve goals faster don't move faster they achieve more with every step this is the basis of leverage they get more for what they put in if you're not moving as fast as you want you're doing the wrong stuff consider the alternative because some of you are still holding on to this and you're but i don't have time it's you're and you'll never achieve the success you want and it's not your fault that feel better didn't think let's assume that you've got the time and you're spending it the wrong way that's number two let's go to the one then fy always a fun one this one kept me stuck for years you think when i have more time i'll do it it's saying i'll save money when i have more money or i'll get healthy before i go to the hospital or i'll i'll get a i'll go to the gym once i have a six-pack you invert the sequence you're getting this you're getting the order wrong you do the stuff now to get the thing later you do and then you get you don't get in order to do that's number three when do you start answer the moment you want to be the future version of yourself aka when when do you want to become the future you or when do you become the future you when you do what they do because if identity is based in action then the moment you start doing the things that future you does you are that person it takes time for the proof to show up but you are that person already and that is enough for you we talked about what how when who and when you should start you're now what [ __ ] i don't know the name of the presentation was how to win remember the whole intelligence and learning thing the longer it takes you to start doing the things what to do and how to do the less intelligent you are and whenever you get stu stuck break things down that you need to do into continually smaller chunks until you understand how to do them whenever you get stuck think oh there are terms or words here that i don't understand i need to break it down more don't let your ego get involved if you're someone says you need to advertise more you got to be what does that mean and you break it down it means post this many i get that it means you have to do 100 dms i got that the reminder is you guys know how to win better than i could ever tell you take the inverted list from earlier write out the things that would guarantee that you lose flip them to what you would do to win and then break down those terms into the action steps of what it takes to be that trait or have that skill traits are skills and then practice it until it becomes second nature and then chunk up in the beginning you have to talk about doing 100 dms once how to do that how to do cold calls and outreach and door knocking and and ads and all this stuff then you can say advertise you can chunk it up because you have more skills and then you measure your success by whether you completed the actions that would make it unreasonable that you will not fail and then you succeed by default what would i have to do to make it unreasonable that i don't become number one list those do those and you will get there but you measure yourself on whether you did the thing that's it yes or no simple and all the greatest games in life that i found marriage health business you never win you don't win at marriage the point is to stay married you don't win at health the point is to stay healthy you don't win at business the point is to stay in business and it shifts the game from winning to outlasting and that means winning comes down to making a decision that you can 100% control which is cool and i'll tell you a little story back in the day i pledged the fraternity and two weeks in my whole pledge class revolted we were this sucks this is what we signed up for this is not fun in parties and girls it's yeah no [ __ ] but it wasn't what our expectations were they sat us down they gave us a pep talk and we got over it and then when i was on the other side i found out that every single pledge class every single year would revolt between day 10 and day 16 every year and i ended up becoming president of that fraternity and it was my turn to give that talk and i go into this this freshman dorm room there's 20 of these guys they're outnumbering me they're we don't you anymore and i said i get it guys i said who here thought that this would be easy no one raised it who here thought it would be hard they raised their hands i was this now i was this is what heart feels you didn't know what heart felt this is what it feels make sense we reset reality this is what hard feels you said you expect it to be hard this is hard they all came back and now you may be at that point in your career and the heart can be different for different people it might be stuck at a certain level of income it might be getting started it might be being number two and wanting to be number one everyone's hard's different but this is what it feels there's a level of uncertainty of not knowing whether your actions are going to yield the results that you want but doing them anyways not knowing if you're going to get credit from the market or on your on your on your check at the end of the month and whether this is the thing that you want to do for the rest of your life everyone thinks these questions but the people who win continue to do the actions regardless which is why i say focus on the activities not on the not on the inside your ears you can feel terrible and still win that's what hard feels this is one of my favorite chinese proverbs everything must be hard before it can be easy what makes things hard is in complexity it's consistent consy as boring as it gets sometimes you have to keep doing it before you get anything back hard times or opportunities to give yourself proof that even this couldn't stop you you're going to lose sleep you'll doubt whether it'll work you'll stress to make ends meet you won't finish your to-do list you'll wonder if you made the call and you'll have no way to know for years but this is what hard feels and this is what you signed up for and that's what makes it worth it and that is in closing said a little mr miyagi everyone here knows what to do to win do all those things that you wrote down make them positive cool figure out those ways to lose and do the opposite how to do it remember you take those things chunk them down break it down small that anyone could do it even a child why you should be doing it you have these opportunities that keep presenting themselves you keep looking at shiny objects but we get more for what we put in when we stick with things wealth is made during the hard times the few people left standing get the most of it you create motivation by changing your environment and who you compare yourself to why you should be doing it because you get outsized returns for sticking to things and you already know how to become the person you can win how do we do that by doing do who means do it's the easiest thing who do i want to become what does that person do i'll do that and when you should start which is if it's not not you're busy now in this season it's the best time to start if you don't have time you're spending it on the wrong stuff and if you think you need to get in order to do you have it backwards when do you start the moment you want to be the first future version of you here's my final reminder if you take one thing from this presentation if you do not change you did not learn and everyone here has things that they've written down from many of the talks of things that you want to do or want to think about or i would encourage you to make that a list of things that you will do and then when you go back to the same condition your same home your same house your same market your same you change your behavior and then that will show that you learned and you took one step to becoming the person that you ultimately want to be thank you transcript ======================================== on november 30th of 2022 the world changed forever artificial intelligence or ai became accessible to the public for free through a tool called chat gpt chat gpt which stands for generative pre-trained transformer a robot you can talk to that you can log on to and have a conversation with and it went from zero to a million users in 5 days which is the fastest any platform has gotten to a million users it took facebook 2 years it took instagram 2 years it took pinterest 4 months and it took angry birds 35 days that it has the potential to unravel the fabric of capitalism itself and what it means for us as individuals and a little bit later in the video i'm going to tell you how you can capitalize on this to 10x how much you make rather than being afraid of it in the short term and curling up in a ball and putting your head in the sand and hoping it goes away it's here and it's only going to get more dangerous and powerful there's five major areas that it's going to completely turn on its head number one is the nature of work itself the second is how businesses operate the third is the economy overall the fourth is how we interrelate with one another on a romantic setting how we choose mates how we seduce how we have sex all of that stuff and finally the nature of life itself and how it extends to interplanetary life and whether or not aliens exist here on earth i'm not a big woooo tin hack guy but if you think through the logic there's some alarming conclusions that you can come to ai is going to be the biggest shift in our lifetime it is the equivalent in my opinion of the moon landing except the only the only difference is that it will change all of our lives rather than being a picture to say that we won the cold war different than the internet phone systems television because what those did was they reshuffled the workforce this has the ability to remove or eliminate the workforce altogether cryptocurrencies in general have the potential to overturn the financial institution ai has the potential to overturn the human institution i try to convince people to slow down slow down ai to regulate ai i tried for years you don't know who i am or you're new the channel my name is alex rosi i'm the founder of acquisition. comom we're portfolio of companies that does over $200 million a year and i make these videos that you can use them and make lots and lots of money and hopefully you become a company between $3 and $100 million and we can invest in your business and help you scale beyond that in order for us to productively talk about ai to understand what the terms we're talking about are ai is a type of technology that helps machines or computers do things that normally need a human brain to do stuff learning solving problems making decisions and understanding what we see or hear the thing that made the release on november 30th wild is that chat gpt democratized access to ai for the first time because it had an interface that we could all use chat they created a massive language model that allowed it to understand our prompts and queries and be able to translate that into machine speak get the answer and then retranslate it back to us in human speak that is what made it powerful because now all of us can use it now chat gpt spits out words sentences paragraphs articles and even entire books it can write legal documents it can can write sales scripts it can write video scripts the list is endless i asked it the other day to write a cold email to a plumbing company for marketing seo services and it spit it out and then i said cool make it funnier and shorter spit out another version and i said great turn it into a text message did it turn it into a tweet storm did it it's difficult to comprehend the extent of it because it's only limited by our ability to ask the questions which i'll get to later because it's going to be important in terms of how you choose to use ai that's words as the output but we understand other things we can interpret images we can interpret videos and we can interpret sounds and the crazy thing is is that ai can do that too open ai also runs del which is an image engine generator and if i said hey give me a guy smoking a cigar looking over a beach where there's a dragon now make it in van go painting style crazy now make me 10 versions of that now if you think about the nature of what a video is back in the day it was used to be a flip book they would take images and they would flip the pictures and then you'd have a video because we can't tell the difference at past a certain speed and if it can make images then if it makes lots of images in a row it can make videos but on top of that if it has the words and it can make the video it can also make the sounds in the near future those will merge and at the same degree the inputs being text or verbal will also merge this is the reason elon musk has been such a big proponent of neuralink he wants to take it a factor further rather than be limited by our ability to speak or our ability to type he wants it to be limited by our ability to think now that may sound science fiction but it's already here many of us were alive during the first iphone launch now we're on iphone 14 or 15 or it's on now what we see today is our first version that we can see chat gpt 100 is going to be significantly more advanced and we'll be able to input and output on demand any of these things the way we want them the next important milestone is when ai enters the physical world elon revealed the tesla bot is that that's what it is today again the iphone in many machine generations which happen faster than generations that will be able to look exactly a human and it will definitely if you look at boston dynamics there's robots that function better than humans that have longer arms and are much stronger and can jump and don't need to sleep and won't have sexual complaints blah blah blah blah blah once those machine generations happen on robotics and on the ai side will reach a point where there's super intelligence and super intelligence is defined as where the ai itself is smarter than all humans but together it takes unique human arrogance to believe that ai cannot supersede at that point the world will change significantly this is where access to the super intelligence will become the most valuable resource on planet earth for example if i were to say hey build me a trillion dollar company it could in real time write the code for the product write the scripts for the ads generate the videos for the ads directly interface with the media buying place the ads where it already knows where the targeted audience is push those targeted audien's eyes to landing pages that it had built with scripts and videos that it had built and then transact all from a single prompt who determines who gets the access will be a important question for the future the second is what will govern the types of prompts and queries that we can ask it if we said how do i wipe out the entire human race for less than $100,000 we don't want it answering questions that there's going to have to be some regulation around this because that's a lot of power if we had a th times the rate of innovation it would be the same as having all innovations between the period of enlightenment and today happen next year and that gives way the last step in the ai evolution which is the singularity the singularity is a hypothetical future point in which technological progress and artificial intelligence will advance to the point where humanity will undergo a transformation beyond which it cannot be seen the first truly intelligent machine will be the last invention that humanity needs to make many people postulate that that's the point where it will become either self-aware it will start to make its own decisions and ignore us it won't want to kill us because it has no reason to for the same reason that we don't want to kill ants but if we build a highway we destroy some anthills it's going to do what it's going to do some robots will eat some jobs and some robots will kill humans you've already seen that with self-driving cars but when you look at the trend of the whole it's going to be incredibly positive for humanity this is why elon and sam alman and those guys are trying to align our goals of humanity with the goals of the ai it's the only productive thought process we can have because we can sit here and be afraid but i don't think we're going to stop the technological progress even if they bann it knowing how the internet is and knowing how black hat coders etc are i have a hard time believing that they will be able to stop it because this will be the equivalent of having the new nuclear bomb of this century or this millennia if humanity collectivity decides that creating digital super intelligence is the move then we should do carefully this is the most important thing that we could possibly do that's all pie in the sky stuff let's talk about day-to-day let's talk about business to frame this conversation you have to watch this clip because it will make everything about to say make sense this is from google and this is from four years ago their personal assistant ai and they haven't released this to the public which is weird don't have out you hi i'm calling to book a women's haircut for a client i'm looking for something on may 3rd sure i give me one nothing mhm first name is lisa perfect i will see lisa at 10:00 on may 3rd great thanks great have a great day bye that's the baseline that was 4 years ago now imagine it was a sales call and we have sales ai that's listened to 10 million sales calls this is the types of things that these people say in these situations i will say the same thing and then it iterates and learns over and over again the ai can live a million lifetimes in terms of the amount of volume it can churn through and process and learn from compared to a human the best sales guy is going to have this much experience compared to the best ai sales guy and if it can have those calls 24 hours a day in real time to prospect you want you may even imagine a world where you ask the phone teller hey are you a human and when they say no i'm ai you're relieved cuz you're thank god i'm talking to the best version of this who can handle my problem now if you were to have asked people what jobs do you think ai will replace first most people said first it'll replace the low skilled jobs the physical labor and then it'll be the low skilled white collar jobs and then it'll be the high white color jobs programmers and coders and then finally maybe it'll replace the creative jobs but what's interesting is that it happened in the reverse order if you're a copywriter this has serious implications for you a logo designer this has serious implications for you customer service 24 hours a day in real time immediate feedback what happens to all the physicians it becomes immediate and more accurate for us to have access to a medical ai from our homes and it can see us because it can interpretate data visually too if you're in finance it will be able to take all of the raw data and realign it and put it into beautiful s sheets friend of mine has a father who's a medical malpractice attorney he asked it to write an argument for why malpractice should not be capped in terms of how much a lawyer can make on a malpractice suit and then it outlined an entire argument for why it should be uncapped it happened to be almost identical to the argument that he had after 40 years of experience videos this all these people on youtube instagram posts what if the ai reads every single instagram post of all time and ranks them by highest performing and then merge that with video and deep fakes we will have pundits and influencers that don't exist imagine you could create the perfect celebrity or the perfect spokesperson or the perfect porn star and with deep fakes they can work 24 hours a day say exactly what you want and what they say has the perfect tone and me to stimulate the out of our dopamine centers and we're going to be plugged in because it knows what we better than we do if you don't believe me go to thisp person do exist.com and keep refreshing it and it will show you new people now if you remember earlier a video is made of multiple images put together back to back to back if it can make an image of a real person it can make many images of real people if it can make many images of real people it can make a video of a real person and then we'll have questions of verification did president biden say that did president trump say that or is it a deep fake the blue check mark will take on an entirely new meaning in the near future now those are a few few use cases but anywhere humans are it will disrupt if you were connected to the ai you can input faster and you can get information back faster because you're not limited by your digits this will be the next order of magnitude in terms of output and value that individuals will be able to create in the economy i do think that there's a chance that capitalism as a system for society may be overturned you're going to have a huge cost basis that's going to be eliminated things make it cheaper but at the same time the money that would have gone to those people that's going to go to the economy won't be there the point is is that there will be significant changes to capitalism overall now one of the nice things sam alman who's the ceo they have been undergoing the largest ubi study a universal basic income study as a result concurrently with this technology he knows what they're making we're going to have an opportunity to push the reset button and think about the world we want and universal basic income is one part of that he knows the impact of what's going to have now in the short term we'll be able to harness this and this is what will foster in at least in the short term a golden age for humanity in terms of what we're going to be able to accomplish scientifically that we will be able to achieve nuclear fusion fusion is renewable clean energy for everyone when you reconstruct the energy infrastructure upon which all of society is laid upon it changes everything and in a real way this will be a more significant change or revolution in humanity in my opinion than the industrial revolution which changed everything but let's talk about a different topic let's talk about romance this is where in my opinion it gets a little bit scary the bottom tier of society have a harder time getting mates girls or guys imagine if we've studied a million tinder conversations to get the first date there'll be tools probably called first date aid i that can ai from first convo all the way to the date getting set let's take it a step further we have the phone version of this and you can hear a voice that has been tuned to your preferences of the exact type of voice that you want to hear that talks to you and listens to you the kind heart that they are and they don't care that you talk too much and you only talk about yourself and when you say these weird things they let it go because we think we're more complicated than you are but we have inputs that our brain interprets from an electrical signal and then assigns meaning to and once the inputs you hit the buttons and that's what it will learn learn how to do now we fall in love with robots take it a step further the tesla bot five generations 10 generations from now looks a human and now has that in the brain what happens when the robot humans are more attractive more loving more caring more considerate and cheaper than a spouse before i explain how you can maximally use this to make the most money and live the best life in the short term based on the skills that we have today indulge me for one more moment because it's profound and it's going to change the way the world let's talk about aliens oh pull it up jamie joe rogan and many people have talked about alien technology and what if there was a ufo that was captured all that stuff let's put a pin in that play this out with me when humans want to explore the universe what do we send first we send mars rover we send a robot if aliens are further ahead of us then it means that they probably have ai if they're going to send something they would probably send a robot why because a robot doesn't need to eat it can live for a long time and it can survive in harsher different climates than biology can on top of that it can work on itself whereas biology cannot aliens might be here but not necessarily in their physical form but in their ai form because if we can create robots that perfectly clone humans can they and that may be who they sent or what they sent to check out what we're doing ai would be the perfect thing to send to another planet because up to this point when we send something it takes 5 years for it to reach planet it's on and by the time it's there it's old technology and it makes sense that you' want to send something that is completely adaptable and can rewrite its own code space exploration may be done by ai more than it is done by humans because this stuff our flesh we super easy to kill but the ai can live super cold super hot no oxygen lots of oxygen it's good and once we solve fusion with it it won't even need the sun which leaves to one question about life itself if we define death as the inability to receive inputs when you die you can't receive inputs anymore and we define personality as the conglomerate of our actions and behaviors as a result of our past experiences then if i were to upload my thoughts and behaviors and past experiences how i talk how i speak how etc into a cloud drive and then it were able to pass the turing test everybody i know couldn't tell whether it was me or robot version of me then is it me and if that thing can now go travel planets is it humans that are traveling to planets or is it an ai cyborg version of humans i don't know interesting questions alex you took me to romance robot wives and aliens how do i make more money today the first thing that i would ask is that you adopt the mentality that ai isn't here to replace me it's here to supercharge me why do i say that because if you adopt the other one you might as throw in the towel now you have to embrace change it's part of humanity technology moves we got to adapt if ai can condense our inputs if i say hey go read this book to ste it down and then give it to me i can now read a book significantly faster if i say hey ai go summarize all my email and all my slack messages and predict what i'm going to say and then all i need to do is validate it i can do a day worth of work in a few minutes of chat gpt and ai of the future as a filter through which we will perceive the world both in and out think of it as your home screen you read everything through ai because it has already distilled it down to the most important nuggets for you then in the output side it makes predictions on what you would say normally and it continues to get training it better and then it sends it we can consume 10 times the information and produce 10 times the output which is 100x increase that's level one the next level is the expert level and these are the people who are losing sleep over being oh my god this thing can now do my job if you're an expert what used to take you 90% of your time which is generating things you now expand most of your time to using the machine to generate and then you spend your time doing qa and validating the information making tweaks and in a real way using these tools you become more valuable to the companies that you work for or the clients that you serve i'll leave you with this this video was made entirely by ai and this is a deep fake i'm kidding but someday it might be transcript ======================================== this is the blueprint to becoming a millionaire and i'm going to walk you through the levels to becoming one level one is the fundamentals of wealth creation and we're going to start with what even is a millionaire it's someone who's net worth excluding their primary residence is an excess of a million do assets minus liabilities for example let's say you own a $1 million house and you owe $500,000 on it if you had nothing else saved up in your bank account which would hope that you did but let's say you had nothing else saved up in your bank account then your net worth would be 500k in this instance you would not be a millionaire now let's call this a $1 million house and then you owed nothing on it your net worth would be a million dollar now there's a difference between having a liquid net worth versus a net worth a liquid net worth is assets that you can trade in and out of if i had million dollars in cash in my bank account versus owning assets that were worth a million dollars those are different things and you might be wondering how does alex have any authority to speak on the subject i'll tell you why i became a millionaire in my early 20s i had my first cash million in my bank account when i was 27 and i cross $100 million in that worth by age 31 i became a millionaire a 100 times in a row i can tell you how to do it at least once and i've helped over a hundred other people create million dollar plus net worths over my career and those are the ones that i know about let alone all the people in our community have done a lot better than that and we go to step two in this little journey of ours which is equity because there's two ways that you can become a millionaire you can earn your way there or you can own your way there and the faster way is to own your way there and that's what i'm going to walk you through i'm going to walk you through both examples of earning your way there which is how i first thought it was versus owning if i want to earn my way to a million then i'm going to need to make $2 million over x period of time and then divide that by two because of taxes to get to my $1 million let's say making $200,000 a year and i make $200,000 a year for a decade that's assuming that you saved 100% of your income you'd be able to earn your way to $1 million in liquid net worth on the other hand you can own your way meaning that you own assets either which could be businesses or real estate which are probably the two most common assets that people own that are trying to invest when i say invest when you are an entrepreneur you are investing you're heavily indexed on one stock which is your own let's say that i create a business that gets to $250,000 per year in some instances i might be able to sell this company if it was truly automated and had a a team of people that worked without me needing it i could sell this at probably a four times multiple and this is again that would be a good multiple for a business that is doing that profit because this is a small amount of profit for when we're talking business sales but that would get us to a $1 million net worth all because we own 100% of this business that makes $250,000 a year in profit without us working at all and we could sell that for $1 million and you can see the difference here it's one of these takes 10 years this one is how long does it take me to automate the creation of $250,000 a year and what's interesting here is that almost the actual income between the two is almost identical but as soon as you achieve it you almost already have the the net worth because here time is working against you because you have taxes and you have your living expenses that are cutting out of this every single year whereas here you get the multiplier without your living expenses with time being an ally for you which takes us to the next step on our journey don't diversify diversification is for weenies diversification to quote uncle warren is a hedge against ignorance you only diversify if you don't know what you're doing the more the less risky it is i am approaching diversification from a focus perspective which is what's the one thing that you're going to invest your most valuable resource because when you're early on you don't have that much money your most valuable resource isn't your money it's your time and your attention there's two ways we can allocate it v1 we do little allocations this i'm going to look at crypto i'm going to look at day trading i'm going to look at forx i'm going to look at flipping houses i'm going to look at long-term investing in real estates i'm going to look into airbnb i'm going to look into starting an atm business i'm going to look at you get the idea let's say this is you and this is your time and attention that you have to pursue any new opportunity you say i need seven income streams because the average millionaire has seven income streams i'm going to spread myself thin between seven different opportunities and while i do that i'm going to be multitasking trying to fill different cups at the same time with different colors and i'm somehow going to wait until one of these things takes off i have to see which one of these will work but the reality is it's not which of these ones will work any of them could work if you put the work in but you have to reach a threshold once you get to the top the extra cash starts spilling over and you have a profitable opportunity which one of these cups is closer to spilling over you going in on one thing or you spreading yourself between seven and the reason that this myth continues to proliferate is because it's absolutely true that people who are the wealthiest have multiple income streams but what's not true is about how they got there the wealthiest people in the world go all in on one income stream and they keep adding it up over and over and over again until it overflows and then once it overflows because they're making much money from their one opportunity they then start diversifying back between the other different ways but they made their wealth focusing on one thing and then they maintain their wealth by distributing it you don't make money by by splitting your attention up you make it by focusing on the one thing that matters most b2 you say what do i i do have experience doing this one thing and i'm going to ignore all of these other opportunities and go all in on one thing the reason i'm such a big advocate of focusing your attention on one thing is that this is where you get disproportionate returns because it's arrogant to think that your 10% of your attention where you're not even that good at business to begin with spread between 10 things is somehow going to compete against somebody who's putting all of their effort on one thing but here's the fallacy that most people who are starting out don't get they think i'm going to try all of them and see which one works out or rather i'm going to try to start multiple things and see which one takes off but the reality is that all of them could take off or none of them could take off but it's solely based on which one you work on it's not which one will work it's which one will you work on you want to go as fast as possible through the i have no idea what i'm doing phas you can get to the i do know what i'm doing faas and i understand the risks that are associated with this and that's why i don't want to diversify because i get outsize returns here there's five stages that you go through as an entrepreneur when you're considering a new opportunity phase one is called uninformed optimism this is where you are uninformed but you're man this opportunity sounds great look at all these people making all this money and then you dive in and then you get to something called informed pessimism you're oh wow this isn't as easy as i thought there's all these other things that they didn't talk about in this ad or in this highlight reel that they show me on this youtube short about this person that made $1,000 a day going from nothing from her home then what happens next is you keep working on it and then you get into the valley of despair sad face sad face this is where most people quit and this is what most people do now dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot they find another one of these things to get into and they go all the way over back here because the think oh no this one has doooo on this side of the fence i'm going to go to the other side of the fence where the grass is green but what they don't realize is when they get into that side it's completely made of manure and that's why the grass is green there's poo on both sides you didn't know about it until you got there all and what happens is people keep repeating the cycle over and over and over again and they never make progress and here's that when you do find something that you're what i this this is harder than i originally thought i need to keep learning wow this is hard there's a lot more pieces to this than i understood at the beginning this is why everyone isn't rich and then something magic happens you then start to have informed optimism you now start to realize you've wrapped your arms around the opportunity is or thing you're pursuing and you're i haven't gotten there yet but i understand the math i understand the process of getting where i am to where i'm trying to go and ultimately this is what i'm trying to do with this blueprint for you is it if i can help you tackle as much of this or at least compress the time that it takes you get here that's a big victory for me and then you finally get to the final phase which is achievement which is you accomplish externally what you set out to and most newbies fall out between here and here and then start this process over again most people only relive this over and over and over again without ever making it to here which then naturally leads you to here because then you have no desire to diversify because you now get it and what do you do when your hair you reset the you reset the target and you say this is where i want to go next and because you've been through this process once you understand that what me going after this 10 times bigger girl sounds amazing i'm going to find out there's some stuff that sucks there's going to be a period where it's going to suck and it's going to feel hopeless cuz i don't see how how to get through it i'm going to keep chugging and then understand how to get there and then i'm going to get there i'm going to repeat the process now we go to the last part of level one of becoming a millionaire the long game if i told you to build the tallest tower you possibly could in 10 seconds here's what you might do boom 5 4 3 2 one time now imagine i told you to build the tallest building you possibly could in 10 days you would probably say what i can probably get some more boxes how flimsy is is this how stable is this do you think this is going to last a long time probably not i might build it piece by piece from the ground up with more stable bricks from day one and i would keep doing it this way and i'd keep adding and keep adding and keep adding and then when 10 days came i might be five stories high and the reason this is such an important frame shift for people is that the fact that they're in a rush causes them to build the thing they want to build differently the fastest way to get to this tall is to build it the exact way i did earlier stack it end to end up to this point but if i then said i need you to build something that's 10 stories tall you would never get there and what happens is people get stuck they get stuck at this level and they can't add another one on top and they stay here and they're why can't i get my million doll business to $10 million and it's because you built it wrong to begin with and as much as this sounds painful sometimes the fastest way to to get to 10 million is to start back at zero and build it to begin with i talk much about long game about making sure that you're building it the way because this thing is never going to last and the hardest thing about building something is that in the beginning you need to have something to sell need your amazing valuable thing and then that's a megaphone it's terrible but then you need to advertise it to let people know about stuff and then you start making sales but the problem is that people get to this point and then think oh i need to do more marketing and sales because that's what made me money but the problem is the more you market and sale the more people find out that this is not a gift and this is a big pile of and what happens is now you've got people who buy this thing and tell their friends this thing stinks and then over time it becomes more and more expensive for you to advertise because your reputation stinks and the way to build it is to understand that you you have to build the thing first and then you got to let people know about it but then you don't crank on this you keep fixing this thing until this guy becomes a happy camper and tells his friends and until that happens you keep making this thing better and this is the same thing as if i did this and kept gassing it that's me vertically building the tower and then reaching a max that i can't go past anymore versus building it that i get people to say wow this thing's amazing and then they also tell people for me that when i get to that point i built it with a huge base of foundation and i can keep stacking on top of it and that's the difference in terms of mindset and perspective of how you build something that's going to last and then along the way with your team and the people that you hire rather than saying hey i need a body in the seat i need a person to do this thing you're who here has talent and i might interview 20 people for one role rather than three i get the person if you feel stuck all the time and you can't make progress you usually need to go back to the beginning and realize that you built a vertical business that had no foundation to begin with and now we have our foundation built for level one of wealth creation level two is all about the actual tactics of getting to making your first million and it starts with finding a hungry crowd let me explain what by find a hungry crowd this guy started a business selling hot dogs and he was given one wish from a genie of what competitive advantage he would be able to have the first thought he had was maybe i'll make my hot dogs cheaper the genie shook his head and was no he's hm what if i made my hot dogss taste better and then genie said no don't waste your wish on that maybe i'll make mine the fastest cooking i can serve the hot dogs faster the genie said that's not what you want to waste your wish on the genie looked at him holding the hot dogs in buns in hand and said it's not about the hot dogs if you want to build an amazing business you want to put your hot dog stand on the best corner in front of a starving crowd because if your hot dog stand is on the corner it doesn't matter how cheap they are how good they taste how fast they cook the moment that hungry crowd walks out and sees your hot dog stand you're going to sell it every time off the bat i want to talk about two key concepts when it comes to finding a hungry crowd one is that we have to understand that the market is always going to be the strongest variable in how much money you make if you're selling toilet paper during coid you're going to sell out because it didn't matter how good your toilet paper was there was a starving crowd and supply demand which is one of the reasons that we have it as our logo it is the strongest force in all of economics and business it is the core thing that everything else is built on and you have to understand that the market is number one if i was trying to sell services to newspaper companies newspaper companies are decreasing by 25% per year compounding negatively in the wrong direction the next lever on this is the offer that you give people if you have a superior offer then if you're in a normal market that'll be the next lever that you have if i say hey start for free and i only get paid if you get some result and it's a truly free lowrisk amazing value and you get results tomorrow offer then you're going to sell 10 times 100 times more than than someone who has a you pay me and maybe you get results and maybe you don't type of service or product the final thing is your ability to persuade ideally go after a big market with an amazing offer and be a hell of a persuader but is you can be terrible at persuading and have a terrible offer and say you can only buy my toilet paper in 80 roll chunks or i'm not going to sell it to you and still sell out during co but if it's not co then it's how can i make the toilet paper offer that i have significantly more compelling and if all the toilet paper offers look the same then it comes down to how i can persuade people to buy mine that's concept one when it comes to finding a 100 crow concept two is the four things that i look for when i'm trying to find that market number one is i want people who are in pain you want to make sure that the people that you were selling to are in desperate need they don't want but must have the thing that you were selling the second is that they must have the ability to buy purchasing power a friend of mine had a business where he helped people who are unemployed fix their resumés that they could get a job now you might be oh wow tons of pain absolutely but the problem was he kept trying to grow this business and he couldn't grow it because they were all broke cuz they didn't have a job the third factor that i look for is easy to target because even if you have somebody using lots of pain who can buy your thing if you can never find them it doesn't matter because they're never going to buy your things they'll never know you exist and if i have the choice between two different marketplaces and one of them is nurses incredibly easy to find or something that is way harder to find psychedelic aztecs in croatia way harder to target and what they might have a huge pain and lots of purchasing power to buy my thing but if i can't find them it's irrelevant the fourth point you want to have is that you have a growing market now i gave the example earlier about the newspapers believe it or not a good friend of mine had a business that sell a rev share model to newspaper he was an amazingly persuasive guy he had an amazing offer off which is zero risk he said let me get a percentage of the revenue that i bring to you all these two things were completely maxed out but he couldn't figure out why his company wasn't growing every year he was beating his competitors and gaining more customers than they were but still slipping away in terms of his ability to grow and it was because the entire marketplace as a whole was shrinking and you want to make sure that you have all four of these things you can't have three of them or two of them or one of them you need to have all four and when you're thinking about what thing you want to sell start with who you want to sell it to you have your hungry crowd now what do you do one avatar one product one channel this is the simplest formula to getting $2 million plus all you have to do is find one person that you want to help it's making sure that you're clear on the one specific person that you are going to help that is the avatar the next thing is you want to give them one product and the reason i say it's one product is that a lot of people over complicate their businesses too early they're man if i want to double my business i should sell them three things and then i'll get them to buy more stuff but is that if you're under a million dollars you're adding a ton of complexity when you don't even have that many customers and most times you'd be better served sticking with the one thing that you're selling and saying how can i sell three times as many of the exact same person and that becomes the problem that you solve but most people get confronted with these issues and then go for the easy route and again this is that building where you can add something on top quickly but it doesn't create the skyscraper that you want instead you want think how can i do more the third variable here is channel now it doesn't matter what channel you're currently acquire customers on you can hit a million dollar plus on any channel that you advertise on without going onto new channels if you do outreach is then you reach out to people 10 to one to get customers whether that's cold calls cold emails dms you can expand and continue to get more customers with that one channel if you post content you can keep posting content on channel you're on and do it better post more cont content post better content and by doing you increase the amount of customers still with only one money-making product or let's say you're running ads obviously if you're running ads you can spend more money on the ads provided you're doing it profitably and if you can't expand past a million dollars a year profitably with paid ads you have a business problem or you have a pricing problem you don't need to add another channel because then it again complicates your business because you're i'm currently doing 500,000 a year on youtube what i'm going to do you might think oh i'm i'm going to start doing cold emails as my next way of getting customers that majorly complicates your business when you're this early on now you might be thinking wait shouldn't i have diversity of of how you acquire customers i thought you said that was a good idea it is but you're small it doesn't matter yet because you're not looking at a potential acquirer who's going to try and look to decrease risk for you you need to get better at doing the one thing that you do cuz you're probably not that good yet and as terrible as that may sound it's probably real all and the fastest way to get to the million is to build it from the get-go and not over complicate your business which means you pick one avatar one product and one channel that you focus on until you get there now we go back to our tactics of building our first million dollars the next thing at level two is our offer now i wrote an entire book on this thing $100 million offers it answers the question what should i sell and it's because that's the most common question that i get asked every single day for people who trying to start a business which makes sense what am i supposed to sell i call this the value equation now fundamentally you've probably heard all over the internet you need to provide value you got to give value but the question is what is value and after doing a lot of studying of figuring this out between our portfolio companies it comes down to four variables variable number one is the dream outcome what the dream outcome is for whoever the prospect that you pick is the way that you can compare two different dream outcomes is how much more valuable they think one outcome is versus another if i were to talk to a 30-year-old man and say hey i can help you lose weight or i can make you a millionaire most guys would value you being a millionaire more than let's say being handsome there are different outcomes that people will ascribe different values to and that's a extreme example let's use the weight loss example and let's switch it to women if i have one ebook that helps someone lose weight and then i've got a one-onone personal training program that have someone lose weight it's the same dream outcome then what then determines which one is more valuable because the ebook might be 50 bucks and be overpriced and the personal training might be $5,000 and be underpriced how can you make that discrepancy because there's more value let me explain the next one is perceived likelihood of achievement meaning when i buy how likely do i will get what i want through buying if i buy a $50 ebook on good meals that i can cook that are healthy maybe i'll get some food that i might in here and i can feel a little better about myself but they don't realistically think that they're going to all of a sudden transform their entire body from a $50 ebook now if you sign up for personal training for a year you probably have a way bigger perceived likelihood of achievement and you value it higher now both of these elements the dream outcome and the perceived likelihood of achievement are the things that you want to increase in your communication with a prospect you're saying it's likely that you're going to get this thing that you want the next two variables of the equation are the painful side of the equation which is what does someone have to give up in order to get it the first thing that we have is time and there's two elements of time there's micro and macro micro is how long is this going to take every day there's a certain amount of time that's going to take on the micro for them to experience the result if i'm talking about the lady who's doing personal training she might have to go to the gym three times a week that's going to take time she might have to prepare food that's going to take time that's on the micro level on the macro level how long is she going to have to do these micro commitments in order to get the macro result that she wants she might have to lose 50 lbs and it might take her 18 months macro the goal is i want this to be as little as possible micro time and i want this to be as short as possible on the macro that when i say hey you're going to get the dream body you want you absolutely know that you're going to get it and it's it's going to happen fast the next thing is effort and sacrifice effort is what you have to start doing that you weren't doing that you don't want to do as a result of the purchase sacrifice are things that you have to stop doing that you wish you could do but can't do anymore as a result of the purchase and for our lovely young lady she's going to have to sacrifice margarit a mondays and taco tuesdays she's no longer going to be able to get to do that even though she wants to do that she's g to have to sacrifice sleeping in on the weekends and she's going to have to start waking up early and working out and eating food that she doesn't and effort and sacrifice tend to be dual sides of the same coin you have to start doing you typically have to stop doing something else the top side we try and increase the bottom side we try and decrease we want to get it to zero because if you think about this in a hypothetical extreme the perfect offer that would have the absolute most value would be the biggest most compelling dream you can possibly imagine that you're absolutely guaranteed to get instantly with no effort if i said you can click a button on my website and then look down at your abs and then have a six-pack that would be the hypothetical extreme value now people can get that through personal training changing their diet and waiting 12 months but because of this the value is significantly decreased because there are costs associated understanding all four of these variables is how you craft offers that get people to say yes and give you money because often times the most expensive part of the offer that you have isn't the money it's the other things that they have to start doing as a result of the purchase those are called hidden costs if i have a marketing agency and i do content for people all and when i start doing content i say it's going to take us 60 days to ramp up we're going to start having two calls a week for an hour you're going to have to fly out to my studio and we're going to record and it's going to take 60 days before you're going to start seeing any traction imagine that offer comp compared to somebody who says you don't need to do anything i can draw stuff on my own immediately start posting and your phone's going to ring today we shoot which one's more valuable it's still the same core services but how we wrap them make them probably 10 times more valuable than they were before and that's why i understand these variables and making the offer is compelling on your road to your first million and the reason this was my first book is that offers is about strategy offers is one of the largest levers that you can pull with any business because it affects all departments when you change the offer it changes how you market when you change the offer it changes the sales script the sales process when you change the offer it changes what you deliver it affects everything and for us we always try and nail this with our portfolio companies at acquisition. comom to be clear we don't sell coaching we invest in businesses and buy them and for context our average portfolio company over the first 12 months 1.8x is revenue and 3.01 x's profit and over their first 24 months they 2.8 8x revenue and 4.7x profit meaning that they disproportionately drop the increase in revenue to their bottom line because we make sure that the thing that we are selling is as valuable as humanly possible the next on our journey of wealth and riches and glory and status and all things amazing is marketing and sales and if you think about this from a sequence perspective you have to make the thing and then you have to promote the thing now the making $100 million offers which should i sell the next question is who should i sell it to aka getting leads and you get leads through advertising which is the concept of my second book $100 million leads and then you get them to buy but the thing that people mess up is that they then think i'm going to do more of that but what you need to do next is you go back to here and you fix the product and keep making it better and then you promote it more and then you come back and fix the product and make it better and it becomes this virtuous cycle if we need to understand how to market and sell then it means that you have to have one advertising method there are eight ways you can advertise there's four that you can do and then there's four that other people can do for you you can do warm outreach which is reaching out one to one to your friends you can post content one to many but to people who know you you can run paid ads which is doing one to many to strangers or you can do one to one to strangers which is cold outreach and if you're man no one's buying my thing i can guarantee you that you're not doing enough of these core four period that's it because these are the only four things that you can do to advertise the next next thing is that you can get referrals from customers which are lead getters next you can have employees who help do the core 4 for you you can have agencies who run the core for for you make content for you do outreach for you all of those things you can hire another business to help you with and then finally you've got affiliates which some people call influencers some people call endorsements but it's somebody who already has an audience already has a business and that you compensate in some way to do the advertising for you the core for to let other people know about your stuff these are the eight ways that you can advertise anything to anyone and the nice thing is when you're starting out for your first million pick one once you pick the advertising method that you want and let's say you're using lead getters you have to learn one of the core four to then get lead getters and that's that's fine that's part of business these will always give you more leverage than the first four and that's but you have to start with these first let's assume that you're going to stick to the core four in the beginning because you're i don't want to involve other parties which i recommend especially if you're starting out and you're what i'm going to post content that's what you're going to do that's your your method all now you're going to have all these people who your posts comment on your posts dm you personally when you make content that they find compelling or interesting and say hey i love your help on this thing is then you transition into sales now it's important for founders who are starting a company to be integrally involved in both of these processes the reason you want the founder to be integrally involved in the beginning is one it's cheaper and especially when you have less cash that makes sense two these are skills that you're going to that are going to be required for you to succeed over the long you're going to want to understand them at a tactical level because when you bring someone else in in the future these lead getters whether it's employees agencies affiliates or you can teach them the way to do it and when they say hey that's not possible you be no it is let me show you how and then you have a litus test of who's legit and who's not who's going to help you on your journey whether you're hiring them or you're incentivizing them it works the same when it comes to the sales side we want to get into a choreograph process knowing what step one through letter z of the process looks to get someone from this might be interesting to giving you money but if you don't know what you're doing first you have to throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks and a lot of it's going to be your gut in the beginning and figure out whoop that didn't work whoop that didn't oh that one got a response all that's step two and you keep trying until you get to step three and then you keep trying until you get to step four until eventually somebody gives you money and then you backtrack and say what happened to this person that do these steps great now i'm going to try and recreate that as many times as i can and then that becomes your process and that process repeats at each micro level too because that might be three or four steps to get to the conversation where someone might give you money and then what do you do in that conversation when i ask this question first and this question second and this question third it's more likely that they ultimately buy and if you don't follow a script in the beginning you better make one because if you're going to eventually get out of sales which you should if you want to scale then you're going to be able to teach somebody else how to sell too and one of the biggest issues early on is that the founder is the most convicted about the product and you should be it's your company but people who come after you are never going to be as charismatic or as convicted in the thing that you have as you are which means you need to follow a process to maximize the likely that the prospects that they speak with ultimately purchase the next level in our blueprint or journey to wealth the mountain of mordor and by mordor more money is paying yourself how much should you pay yourself when should you pay yourself of all the topics we're going to talk about today this is probably the most subjective and the reason for that is because it underlines one key concept that is 100% personal which is risk tolerance which is how much risk are are you willing to take individually one of the regrets that i have earlier on as i continued to double down on my gym chain was that i took all the profit from each gym and i kept putting it into the next gym and i took nothing out for the entire time now that's super risky i was living on nothing living cheap i was eating cheap i had a cash car that i owned outright and i put everything i had spend every hour of my day growing my business eventually though i ended up losing all the money from selling all my gyms and was left with nothing and if i had taken out some cash during that period of time i would have had to benefits benefit number one is that when you try and take out cash flow from the business you'd be amazed at how much cash flow magically appears and i having bank account prs be a good personal goal for every entrepreneur even if the increment that increasing is small it does two things one it forces you to take cash out of the business it forces cash flow the second is that it forces you to decrease your spending personally and i have a strong belief that as you're coming up learning the discipline to spend less if you increase the cash for that you take out of the business and you spend less over time then your bank account has nowhere to go but up and i can promise you that when you have a full bank account business decisions become less stressful and when you make less stressed decisions you make better decisions i do believe in taking some money out of the business along the way because let's be real you're going to live a long life and then you're going to die and if you double down every single minute until the day that you died you'd build the most enterprise value you live a shitty life at some point you have to balance the investment versus consumption of life itself or the fruit of your labor that is why i'm a believer in at least allocating a certain percentage of the cash flow from the business to you personally a healthy way of thinking about this that we have for some of our heavy capital intensive businesses meaning brick and mortar chains which is one of the biggest parts of our portfolio this is one back of napkin way that you can use 33% goes to you 30% goes to growth which is new locations and then this is rainy day this is cash reserves for the business cash reserves for you and this is for new location another way of doing it is something called a watermark we know that we need to grow two locations and this is a proxy it doesn't have to be two locations you could be hiring two people hiring two reps it doesn't matter two more developers if you're a software company it works the same two more per month cost $ x we have y profit all we do is we say the profit is at the end of the month we subtract this and then we have a watermark above which we always leave in the account and then everything else we distribute this cash flow that's a different way of doing it this is a little bit more aggressive if you want to maintain a certain growth rate this one is a little bit more flexible it depends on you and your tolerance for risk and that's one one thing that i'd say i pride myself on in terms of our ability to help portfolio companies and newer founders who are creating their first generational wealth is these are hard conversations to have and a important conversation to have and you want somebody who isn't a financial adviser who's trying to get you to take as much cash out that they can invest and get their 1% fee you want somebody's on the same side of the tables you' be i get where you're at i can see where your wealth is and also sees over the next 24 36 60 months what it looks for us to have that one big bloop you never have to work again we're now approaching the second level the pinnacle of our second level which is setting goals and this is a disinterested topic most people think oh i need smart goals or specific go b i'll show you how i do that all rather than focusing on outcomes we focus on activities the goal shouldn't be what happens but the goal should be what we do i i had a buddy of mine they started doing 10 grand a month 20 grand a month 30 grand a month and then he would fall off and i was why do you keep falling off he's said i make the money and i hit my goal then i ease off the gas p and i said it's because you're defining your goals the wrong way i see you as not hitting your goal every time you're not doing the activities and i said make the activities the goal and then you'll hit it every time and more and then he flipped how he saw his own success into simply did he do all the things that he said he was going to do at the beginning of the day and then you can control your inputs because inputs are what drive outputs don't make the goal outputs say what am i going to do that would be unreasonable that i don't hit these outputs for example my inputs might be and this is one of my favorite ways we're thinking about advertising is something that i call the rule of 100 the rule of 100 simply states that if you do 100 primary actions over 100 days you'll usually get the first result that you ultimately want now you hook people by saying you're going to get the first result you want but the key point is that you're doing 100 actions and one of my little monitors that i would share with you is count in hundreds all when a lot of people are man i did the thing how many hundreds did you do if i was doing more reach outs i'd say cool reach out to 100 friends a day if i'm doing cold reach outs i' say cool reach out to 100 people a day if i'm making content cool make 100 minutes of content every day if i'm running ads i' say run $100 a day and each of those are activities that we can say these things will drive these outputs they make that the goal and you can say yes i did it or no i didn't do it not did i make a sale because no matter what even if you didn't make a sale today you should still do your 100 inputs that you can make two sales tomorrow the second con i'm going to talk to you about when it comes to goals is how we set goals for portfolio companies and it's not the way that you think but it is something that you're going to recognize because we use the scientific method and here's how it works four simple boxes one is what problem are we try to solve a lot of times we spend the most time on this part of this because a lot of times people are oh we need to redo our logo why what is that going to accomplish what constraint are we alleviating because for us we back our goals into the constraints of the business because let's say that conversion rate on our homepage is not a problem then why do we need to redesign the logo oh we don't one of my favorite ways to solve problems is decide they not a problem to begin with this is column number one which is what problem we're solving the second is what's our hypothesis which is an if the end statement x then y what that means is i say my hypothesis is if our website is low conversion that's the problem that we're solving my hypothesis is that if we redesign the website we will then get increased conversions and then all we have to do is say how do we measure x and y how do i measure that we redesign it i could say yes or no i did it or i could say that we hold a split test every monday that we run over the quarter that would be the x that's something i can say yes or no we did and then why my conversion rate let's say we're at 10% and then i would say is it greater than 10% yes or no and then finally the last thing is did we do it and then did it work we figure out the problem we're solving we figure out what our hypothesis is to solve it we determine how we're going to measure whether or not we did or whether or not it happened and then we say did did we do the thing and then did it happen because we could not do the thing and then it wouldn't matter and we'd have to repeat it later and solve the problem why are we not doing this thing but if we did do the thing then either it improved it or maybe we redesigned the website and the conversion rate didn't improve either that might not be the constraint or hypothesis was wrong and this allows you to iteratively improve the business we covered the fundamentals of wealth creation and we talked about how to create our first mil and now we've got it and now level three we're going to talk about stay rich and get even richer getting rich once one of my mentors was ex goldman sachs and chloe one of his mentors at golden sachs told him you should only have to get rich once and i heard that saying it's stuck with me is if you play the game you should only have to play it once and then after that you should be paying with house money the whole time and never take bets that you would lose the farm over in other words never b the empire on a pot of gold if this is the first pass in $100 milli offers outside returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually given a 10% chance of 100 times payoff you should take that bet every time for you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10 we all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how you connect with the ball the most rs you can get is four in business every once in a while when you step off to the plate you can score 1,000 runs this longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold big winners pay for many experiments that's from jeff bos if you do hit it out of the park you shouldn't want to have to bet everything on it again to keep staying rich when you get that one winning bet or that one winning ball that comes and you knock it out of the park you shouldn't you should be able to win for good and that's why one of my favorite saying when it comes to wealth building is that fortunes are created through taking huge risk with small amounts of money but for fortunes are preserved by taking small risks with lots of money we talked about why you should only have to car which once and if you are going to swing for the fences you still need to be sure that once you hit it you never bend it all on black again which then leads us to our next one people sobody to explain a concept called the quad marketing calendar all you think about this as internal and external to your business now you got prospects on this side we got customers candidates we got employees and you need to be marketing in all four directions at all times most people spend all their time advertising here they say i'm going to spend all my resources advertising to get prospects and then they convert those prospects over this money line and then turn those prospects into customers but the problem is if you own only advertis in this direction who's going to deliver the thing to these customers you need employees which means that you also need to be advertising to get candidates to turn into employees and this is ultimately the dual-sided nature of advertising because as you grow the left side you need to also grow the side if you want to continue to get these customers to buy again and again and again then we also need to advertise in this direction to the customers to get them to buy again and again we advertise your prospects any customers we advertise to get customers to become repeat customers we advertise the candidates to turn them into employees and we advertise the employees to get them more engaged and to keep them engaged and and keep educating them they can ascend up and provide even more value to our customers ul the enterprise value company if you ever feel you're a genius with 1 th000 hands it usually you're good at advertising and turning prospects into customers but you're bad and turning candid into employees and then training employees to get to become even better and the more you advertise here the more you feel you have to do because you have no one else helping you out let's say we've got our genius scenario we've got an enterprise scenario if you're the genius with 1 th000 hands and you're making $5 million top line and $2 million of income every year you make $2 million which adds a million after taxes to your net worth this is a while before but here's the difference between the example i'm explain now what i was talking about before in this instance you add the million dollars to your business but you also have a probably $10 million asset as a business if this thing truly rubs value ev is short for enterprise value there is no enterprise value here because it's a genius with 1,000 hands you're doing with a th000 helpers here you own something that provides value to a group of customers that you can sell to somebody else because if if you require no work in order to provide the value it means it require someone else to do no work to provide the value which means it becomes a more valuable asset and if i took a business for genius with a th000 hands making $2 million a year and i didn't increase the revenue and i didn't even increase the profit but i simply remove the genius and make the structure of the business genius the people who work inside of it and the processes the systems that they follow genius then i add $1 million the net worth of the person who owns it and one of the fastest ways to create wealth is make the thing that you have reliable is to make it risk-free and make sure that it will last and even if it took you two years to do that for you to get $10 million of enterprise value or or net worth gain you'd have to make $20 million of income to get to that same 10 million but meanwhile while you're building it you're still also making money in this scenario which is what we do for the majority of businesses that we have at acquisition. is that we often take business as doing 2 million 3 4 5 etc and then then take them to this side and say hey let me show you what looks at 10 with a 7x multiple and now you go from a one or2 or $3 million net worth to a $70 million net worth and that is how you get wealthy this is how you get rich now i want to be clear you can absolutely get to million a year in profit with not a lot of people or even on your own because with the increas of ai and automation that we're going to see more big companies with fewer and fewer head count but until the day until general ai comes in and crushes everyone people are still required to get to where you want to go if you want to not make a million bucks or a couple million bucks and you want to get to 10 20 50 $100 million and beyond you got to get the people side and now we go to the reputation side ooh a fun one imagine all these flowers as different life experiences that you've gone through if you look at them all here this isn't a bouquet this is a lot of r things put together now when we do this and we combine them all we now have something much closer to a bouquet and when you put all of your personal life experiences and your skills and your character traits together you create a bouquet and in other words you create a reputation but a bouquet doesn't exist all we did was we associated things that were separate and then we put them together and you can strengthen your reputation by putting more and similar types of experiences together you're oh he's got a strong interest in this thing now if every single one of these would be different and some of these were weeds it would be a lot harder to understand what is the point of this thing and let's say that you had a drunk driving accident all of a sudden how different does this bouquet look which shows you how one negative experience in your life can affect how people see the rest of everything else and when we're thinking about brand or building a reputation i to think of as what flowers do i want in my bouquet and which things am i ultimately trying to emphasize or not include at all and what associations are going to be ones that strengthen this and width are going to be ones that break it apart reputation is a different word for saying what a brand is and a brand is simply an association between something and something you don't know when we're building a brand you want to associate all the things that you want someone to think about you with the thing that they don't know yet which is you now for me the more my personal brand has grown the more i have transposed acquisition. comom association with me and now when my team goes out to the airport and is wearing a hat that says acquisition. comom people are dude can i buy that hat from you because they've gotten value for my videos in my books they see an association with that value and they want to pay for it but if this had a random shape on it they would have no desire to pay 50 if this happened one my director of hr the airport and a random person came up was can i pay you $100 for the hat and she said no obviously because that's not how our brand works got to earn it the idea is that that is fundamentally how braiding works if i'm louis vuitton i'm going to do the world's worst louis vuitton symol if i'm louis vuitton what do i do i get kim kardashian to wear my clothing or carry my purse and then lady who doesn't have status says man i want to be him but i can't buy kim i buy the thing that i've associated with kim and then when i wear it i'll have the status by proxy from her and that's fundamentally how the luxury market works but it's also how every market works now why do brands drop celebrities when they make a racial slur or they get into an accident or they get arrested for fraud because that becomes an association that people do know and then they don't and they say i don't want to associate our with that and they say we're going to break this association and when you're building a brand it's being particular about what and who you want to associate with if i have a porn star next to me and i have a porn star co-host you're going to think different things about me even if the material is exactly the same you might be that's flawed welcome to humanity and psychology doesn't matter about whether it's flawed or not i can tell you that this is how it works and when you're building a reputation especially in the bdb or the bc space you want to provide value we talked about value creation earlier and it means that you want to give things that people want fast and easy way for them to consume that's risk frea and when we do that you compound customer surplus the street word for that is goodwill which is what amount of value did someone get in excess of what they paid for let's say i paid a doll for something and i got $5 worth of value everything here between the two lines is customer surplus or what we to call goodwill but the interesting thing about this is that if i do this over and over and over again these things aren't additive in my experience they've been multiplicative meaning if i keep providing something good and that's why it's hard as a brand to decide when do i want to monetize something because is that the next time you provide even more value when people think that you're going to monetize they love you that much more and you get that much more reach and more goodwill that the next time and it's reinvesting but rather than reinvesting capital you're reinvesting goodwill because what i can tell you is that goodwill compounds faster than revenue you can build a100 million brand in 3 years and to build $100 million in revenue might take you way longer than that and that's because if you focus on providing goodwill at scale you get a disproportionate return the rock was able to overnight build teramana into a 6 bill billion dollar company simply based on his brand and qu a beauty buil her beauty line into a billion dollar brand conor mcgregor with proper 12 billion dollar brand george clooney billion dollar brand and they understood this concept which is that this will grow faster and they disproportionately invest early into this that later they can monetize and do the hook the big bloop to the audience and to quote uncle warren it doesn't matter how much goodwill you have any number no matter how big it is multiplied by 0 equals z if you make a bet in the investing world that you then lose all the money and you had 30 years of good investing make and you go all in on one bet and you lose you lose it all you undo 30 years of good decisions with one bad decision and that's the thing a lot of people calculate when they think about their personal brand if we're going back to these flowers i had earlier if i have this one broken flower it forever affects the way this bouquet looks imagine you gave this to your wife or your girlfriend and you said hey here you go you'd be it's such an eyesore that it distracts from all the other flowers that you have and that's why making sure that you never risk your reputation to make the short money that you can let the goodwill keep compounding let the party keep going is one of the smartest and hardest long-term business decisions cuz believe me if i start an only fans tomorrow i'll bet you probably make a lot of money it's but it would be this broken flower and it would permanently affect how people perceive it and the brand that i also want to buil now we finished reputation and we're going to talk about compounding one of those big fancy words for investing about how to get rich and stay richer compounding is when something multiplies unto itself all if i have a $100 and it compounds at 10% a year next year it'll be at $110 the year after that i add 10% of this number which is on 121 and then the next year 133 and forth and you notice that even though the time between these intervals remain the same the actual amount that we're growing continues to rise proportionally to how much we have which is how uncle warren can have a$1 billion and still make another $15 billion this coming year is because he understands the power of compounding and they call it the eighth wonder of the world and in the last decade waren buffet has made more money than he made over the rest of his career and that's because the longer you do it the better it guess which is why some of these early wealth building fundamentals are important compounding only unlocks if you have a long-term perspective because this early first four years decent but not bad but if you do that over 30 years it becomes unbelievable and it's also why you have to not diversify because if we were then splitting this up and saying what maybe i'm going to stop this we're interrupting the compounding process and equity is one of the single greatest compounding vehicles because you can reallocate capital within the same vehicle and a simple example of that would be if i have 10 locations and i can grow by 10% every month then i go from 10 locations to 11 locations and next month i get 12 locations next month i get 13 and by my 20th month i can open two locations i get to 22 then 24 and it compounds because by that time you'll built out the infrastructure ructure to sustain a faster pace panda express they added 600 locations this year they had 2,000 at the beginning of the year that took them 45 years to get to this is one year they grew more in this one year than they did in any prior year before that and that's why you have to stick with it for a long period of time and this is one of the things that people don't realize about restarting when you go from year 10 to year 11 you might be incredibly bored with your business but if you go from 100 million to 110 million you grew by 10 million and even though this new thing might sound more exciting in year 1 the liky you go from 0 to 10 million year 1 is unlikely and this is where all of the compounding is unlocked even though it's incredibly boring but if there's one thing i can have you write down boring is what makes you rich one of my favorite codes for charlie longer is that the money isn't made in the buy or the sell it's made in the weight and the weight is the hardest part because you have to sit with your hands in your pockets and decide that the original plan that you had was a good plan and the hard part of the plan is sticking with the plan not doing the plan deciding that you're going to work out isn't hard deciding that it's going to be 3 days a week for the year is it hard it's continuing to do it for that entire time is what makes it hard and i wanted to find a term for you that has been helpful for me which is patience a lot of people be patient be patient what does that mean being patient simply means needs figuring out what to do in the meantime is i make this video i being patient for my stocks that are growing now while i'm making this video i'm being patient for the cup that i want to lose some fat while i'm making this video now i'm being patient for some of our portfolio companies to capitalize on the reinvestments that we're making now but i'm making a video and what you have to do is that when you stick to the plan sometimes the best thing you can do is ignore and let it be which means that you don't interrupt the compounding process and there's a famous study that studied patient and impulse control and there's a one big learning that all of us can learn from there was a test called the marshmallow test they took little kids and they can put a marshmallow in front of them and they wait 30 minutes and then they can eat the marshmallow now if they eat the marshmallow during the 30 minutes they didn't get a second marshmallow if they able to wait 30 minutes and not eat the marshmallow then they would give them a second marshmallow at the end they got double the reward simply for waiting 30 minutes now what was interesting is that they studied the difference between the kids who could resist and the ones who could and obviously long term they figured out to the people who could wait and delay gratifications the ones who were more successful but the strategies that they used to delay was not that they stared at the marshmallow and used their whow the kids who were successful did a number of different things some of them went to a different side of the room they distanced themselves from the marshmallow itself some of them started singing songs to themselves other of them took the marshmallow and put it in their pocket they couldn't see it anymore and the big thing is that they had the skills to figure out what to do in the meantime and the more skilled you are the more ways you can win and that's why building skills is important and it's important because it allows you to be patient it gives you something to do in the meantime while you allow your master plan to come to fruition without thinking that you're smarter than you are to begin with this concludes almost the get rich for die trying sex ak level three of wealth building let's oh wait alex you laugh that b box excellent observation that brings us to the last level which could even be above the levels the level above the levels on the business not in the business what i'm saying enjoy your w let's talk about it in my opinion there are two levels of w level one is that you have all of your personal needs taken care of the second level of wealth is the unlimited level of wealth which is that you always want to keep using money to make more money and that means that you've progressed from solving your personal needs to playing a game and what a lot of people is they can never figure out what enough is for them and there was a period in my life earlier on where i was let me figure out all these rich people things i bought a bentley i was let's go out to all the nicest restaurants every single night but is that to live the 1% it's not that expensive if you fly private and it cost about $50,000 per month if you want to eat out every night of the week at the nicest restaurants of $500 dinners every single night it's 15,000 a month if you wanted to let's say lease a lamborghini or something payments are probably 5 grand a month on top of that let's say you want to go and buy designer clothing that's another $115,000 per month let's say you spend $5,000 a month on a nutritionist and another $55,000 a month on therapy and performance coach all let's call it a cool $100,000 per month of expenses oh we forgot to where we live let's let's live something of ball let's put another 50 grand a month on here $150,000 a month is under $2 million a year in income now that's after tax maybe close to 4 milon a year in income now that's a good amount of money it's not a lot in the massive scheme of things and what is that you can ball out all the way balls to the wall for the rest of your life on this level of income what i would encourage you to do is figure out what is good for me maybe it's worth it to taste these things and see which of them you enjoy and it was doubtable for me to buy the belly and realize i didn't care and then i gave it back 6 months later i sold it back at a lost the big tldr here is that you need to figure out what your personal dream list is and a lot of people have these huge goals i want to be a billionaire it's why because you can make this for the rest of your life and ball out but real real you can probably live incredibly comfortably on $50,000 a month still 1% living unbelievable wealth looking stuff for for $50,000 a month after taxes if you put what does food look what does travel look what does clothing look what does experiences look what does health look and you start putting an actual number to it you realize that what you need to satisfy your personal needs to give you less than you originally thought and that brings me to the next level of this which is the game itself now there's a reason that my podcast is called the game and it's because at this point i play the game because i enjoy the game and the whole concept of enjoying your wealth is not about not working and this is one of the big myths you might feel that way now because you hate what you do and the fact that you hate what you do is one of the reasons they might not ever get the wealth you want and it's not about not working it's about getting addicted to freedom and freedom again doesn't mean you don't work it means you have the option to work and that humans are our best when we do work that's worth doing when we have purpose that we derive from the effort and the toil that we put in every day and you get weaker when you don't have an opposing force that's as strong as you if you lift weights and you never lift even close to your maximum you eventually start losing muscle and it's the same thing with mental strength unless you're continually raising the bar you eventually attri it's use it or lose it and most of us want to become the best versions of ourselves and in order to become the best versions of ourselves we have to increase the difficulty of the level that we're playing on imagine playing a game that you' beaten 100 times and then you put it on the easiest level it gets boring we think we want easier but we don't we want to do things that we enjoy more and enjoyment and easy are not necessarily the same thing and if we're trying to enjoy our wealth it's finding the things that we can lose ourselves in for the rest of our lives and being with the fact that that thing may shift over time in terms of what it looks or what it feels and if you fast forward all the way to the end of the movie as a reminder you die and you can't take any of it with you and even if you if you finish your life with this big pile of money at the end you still have to push it over the edge of the cliff where it falls off to other people whose hands are here because you're yeah and reminding myself of that fact every single day reminds me that the whole point of the game is to play the game and by playing the game we win the game because the best games in life and i'll finish with this the best games in life are infinite games not finite games and i'll tell you the difference the point isn't to get married the point is to stay married when it comes to business the point isn't to win at business the point is to stay in business and keep playing and when we think about the greatest games that we play as humans we have to take this infinite frame or we fool ourselves into a false finite prison that we keep wondering why we don't feel we're winning when we get to the finish line because we never realized that there was no finish line to begin with and the fact that we were playing the game secured our victory by its nature and this realization helped me reframe how i thought about spending my time that i could enjoy my wealth the point for me is to stay in business and see who i can become in this process the point is for me to see what does it look at 20 years of marriage with health it's not that cool i've been training for 20 years i'm in decent shape i wonder what it looks when i'm healthy at 50 because if you're only in shape for 6 weeks of your life or 6 months of your life or even 6 years of your life who cares if you only have a good marriage for a few years of your life who cares if you only in business and then go out of business quickly and you get out of the game who cares and which is why the biggest hiway that you can have and this is from winston chal you win as long as you never quit and that's how you enjoy your life and your wealth and there's your blueprint transcript ======================================== you guys want to hear something completely insane yes you're gonna have to hear it anyways i was able to take home more in a year than the ceos of mcdonald's ikea ford motorola and yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s for over half a decade there you go which which resulted in 200 million dollars in portfolio revenue as of today we crossed 100 million dollars by age 33 and no one's more surprised than i am about this alcove and me expressing this will create envy in some people it will create anger in others skepticism in most confusion in old people and inspire select few and the select few you or who i'm making this for everyone else you can tell but you are the people that i'm making this for let's go back there we go who wants to hear about some stuff that can shortcut their path to material success they can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with all we're going to cover three things today this is fresh from this morning off the press number one how i'm making money works number two why new stuff is making you poor number three why better is the way you're that doesn't make sense yet it will said simply who wants to make lots of money funny thing what you're watching now is not my original presentation i changed it at the last minute the night before i went out to get dessert a bunch of people from the event were in town going to the place that i was by accident as soon as i left the frozen yogurt lunch where i was i was the presentation i have for tomorrow isn't what these people need and i spent that night and all morning making entirely new presentation which is what you are watching who believes that you have to work hard to make money who believes that no one can outwork them you're gonna see where i'm gonna go with this i'm going to attempt to prove you wrong the reason this is important is that all of us claim or i have hurt who here has seen a guru on the internet say no one can outwork me who's heard people say that on podcasts make instagram posts about it it drives me [ __ ] bananas and it drives me bananas because it teaches the wrong lesson how can we claim that we work every day and yet we can't even define the word how do you define work the science definition is work equals force times distance problem with that is it's not useful for knowledge workers most of us are not doing manual labor not useful the second way is that you can think about in terms of inputs of time is that how hard you work no one can outwork me i work longer hours do you think you're the only person who works 16 18 hours every day go to china i'm i don't even know if anyone in america can say it i'm being dead dead serious that's why when i see these things drive me [ __ ] nuts the problem with that is that many people work all the hours they're awake and if you suggest working more hours then you're sleeping less and i don't think that's a good idea for knowledge workers why can no network you again everyone's working those hours then the next one is that's how no one can outwork me no one's gonna try harder than me you want participation trophies is this how you want your employees to think that they're working hard not me i wouldn't want that if it's not force times distance to define what work is and if it's not the amount of time we're putting into the work that we do and it's not the effort that we are expending or how hard we try then what's work we have to get clear on it because if that's what we have to do to make money we got to know what we're trying to [ __ ] do here's alex's definition work equals outputs fancy image outputs equal volume times leverage in plain speak number of times you do something times how much you get out of each time you do it how do we work faster work rate equals that same thing divided by time plain speak output per minute of time that is how you work faster which means that the hardest working man in the world can be objectively measured that guy is the hardest guy working in the world in 2022 he added 140 billion dollars in net worth for context that's more than bill gates did his entire career in one year think about that for a second and then the next year he did the exact same amount again fyi that's 2 billion a week output divided by time there's the time one year there's the output he's the hard work hardest working guy who's going to be the 2027 champ point of me doing this is i hope it's somebody here who did who would to be the 2027 champ all let's rock if you want to be it then please pay attention this will help you how can we get more output which in the game of business is enterprise value it's how much [ __ ] is worth outputs we have this one and i've got a nice flexi arm volume is the number of times we move the leather i made all these images this morning all i'm proud of them all volume is the number of times you move the lever the leverage is the length of the lever itself that you're using the outputs is how much you can lift on the other side let's look at a couple examples you guys can shout it when i say say high or low high or low high or low hi higher low high the reason i put this one in here is that at a certain point it's not about how strong the person is it all depends on how much leverage you have that's the point of the slide now higher low volume times a thousand the thing's as long as the other one highest yes now that we understand what work is you can either do more activity or you can do it with more leverage to get more output doing more is cap by time and physical ability how much you get aka leverage is uncapped no cap i learned that gen z there we go now fun fact warren buffett took home 500 million in dividends last year from coca-cola as an owner the ceo took home 50. he spent less time working on coca-cola than the ceo did is he working harder by the definition that we did yes more output we've been playing the game wrong if you want to outwork your competition what you should be doing is out leveraging them who gets more done we got one person who's 100 calls a day another person is 100 calls a day the guy who has more skill one guy makes 100 calls another guy makes 100 calls the guy who's better on the phone gets more output let's say they're equal skill they're working eight hours a day making calls oh i forgot to ask a question who gets more work done there's the answer the guy that has the automated dialer that keeps his talk time the highest same skill same number of hours and same automated dialer to maximize talk time now who gets more work done the guy who has the best list they've got the same list the same skill same dialer eight hours a day the guy who's calling to the season the time to die who wants to be calling selling [ __ ] during december if you're selling physical products who wants to sell on black friday of course more leverage same work more output let's say all this stuff's equal now who's now who's even all we got what else do we have nice he called it the guy calling with the better offer now we've got the same time same time of year same list same offer same dialer equal skill eight hours a day now who's gonna do it it's got to be equal now the guy who recorded his pitch and send it to 10 million people now to push this even further what if the guy made zero calls and didn't do anything who makes more against the best caller on earth the guy's got a team he's got 15 dudes on the phone how good you are and if you're i could be 15 it can't be 1500. who you are leverage and that guy made zero calls i have more people calling for me today while i'm on stage leverage the game is rigged and you've been playing by rules that do not exist if you want to make more money you need to get more for your time you need more leverage and this should make sense because we all trade time for money and i can prove this to you you spend time every second of your life you receive money over the time that you are alive money divided by time equals rate of output we are all paid dollars per hour the reason i'm specifically saying this to this audience is that you all get fooled all the [ __ ] time by passive income it's not passive it's less active but it is not binary it is not active or passive it's how active is it if you make one trade in the stock market all the time it took you to analyze the deal and every other deal you decided not to do and then execute the trade and then raise the money and do all the other stuff that is all the time that it took you to do that now after that point you have increasing returns per unit of time is this making sense the point i'm making here is that time is the thing we all have the same twenty four dollars in our wallet it's about how we allocate them and what we get back for them how we trade said that there you go degrees all that leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out there are fancy definitions for it this is the best one that i have and i said i would cover three things the first one is how making money works the answer to that question is leverage you make more money by trading your time for more [ __ ] more output the second is why new stuff is making you poor and this is especially relevant for everyone here part of this again was inspired by the conversations i was having last night at yogurtland thank you for everybody who shout out for that this is also how not to get leverage and i felt compelled to make this because i hope that some of you identify with this because i would bet that the majority of you are doing this how not to get leverage there are five pieces to this that i want to break down today number one uninformed optimism number two is a story i'll tell you about a construction buddy of mine number three is something i call the magic wand story number four is half bell bridges number five is one with the red dress you're i have no [ __ ] clue and that means you will let's start with uninformed optimism who here has seen this this is stages of change stage of transition anyone seen this this chart before cool not a lot of you perfect there are five steps and i remember the first time i saw this it it changed my life whenever you're analyzing something new who here has had a buddy tell you about something that they're doing and they're making a lot of money doing it and then you immediately feel shitty about what you're doing and then think i should get out of my opportunity vehicle go over here and do what they're doing who's felt that thank you everyone has the reason is because we're at step one which is uninformed optimism you don't know enough about what they're saying they're giving you the highlights they're giving you the instagram reel they're not giving you the real once you decide to get out of your little vehicle and then going over there then you tell your buddy you're hey why am i not making money he's oh there's a hundred other [ __ ] steps that i didn't talk to you about in the beginning but and it's nearly impossible and i got lucky that one time and and now all of a sudden it looks all the people at your old job are making more money than you but yeah let's keep doing it you move to st stage two which has informed pessimism you are now aware of the [ __ ] that is involved to make the money that you want in this new thing now you think this is probably the worst part but then time elapses and it's still shitty and you still haven't made money yet it blows more now because you have invested more time and still have zero your actual output to time is low rate which is why it's painful which is where people get into the crisis of meaning why the [ __ ] am i doing this what does money even matter anyways what i'd be happier if i spent more time with my kids you change your goal because you encounter difficulty and it happens most times is that people then crash and burn i'm going to skip one forward and then i'm going to come back because i want the visual to work the way i want [ __ ] it if you're at the crisis of meaning this is where most people offshoot what happens here where that that fourth dot there on the bottom if i were to cross it out and write uninformed optimism again that's what most of you do you find about something cool inform pessimism it sucks oh [ __ ] it's way harder than i thought uninformed optimism i'll try something else and then you do it again and again and again and the difference between video games in real life where you you face the boss and you can't pass the level until you beat the boss is that when you die in the video game you restart a few seconds later in the game of entrepreneurship you start years later this is why people don't progress they keep fighting the same boss that can't learn the same [ __ ] lesson they keep losing and i'm saying this because some of you i heard at yogurtland and i know that that's representative of other people here you keep fighting the same boss and the boss is being able to stick with it is getting through in different charts on this the crisis of meaning is also called the valley of despair is getting through from there you get into informed optimism you figure out that little thing i had to do this one thing and then this started working and then what i found out i could clean the list through this tool i found on the internet because i joined this forum and they started doing that and then all of a sudden my pickup rates tripled or my response rates tripled or my throughput on my website went up it is and you have to get through that piece then you get to informed optimism and the number six you achieve and then all your friends are yo what are you doing you're oh i got this thing and then all of them come that is where most people start something new over and over and over again and they don't learn the lesson and this is what their life looks over and over and over and over again who here has more than one business in the last 24 months be honest thank you for being honest i appreciate it first thing it's normal i had nine businesses and i was broke i say this with the pain of experience i'm not saying this to to be on a pulpit i'm saying it because the faster you can get through it the faster you will start making money you have to beat the boss everyone thinks the grass is greener but the other side's still aligned with [ __ ] that's why the grass is great there's [ __ ] everywhere i have a cfo who's been with us for a long time she went through all of our exits last year she's probably almost 60 and she has to sing she's it's all [ __ ] doesn't matter what business it is they all got [ __ ] she's southern and suzanne's awesome but it always reminds me of this is that there's always [ __ ] and whenever we're starting something new we encounter something that we didn't know before and we're oh this makes this shittier and then we think are we going to jump out no this is new information great we're more informed fantastic that is the thing number one that is keeping you poor uninformed optimism number two is a little story i want to tell you i was called up probably two three years ago by a guy i knew in high school we hadn't talked in a while and he said hey i've got this roofing business i want to scale it i want to go big i was that's awesome man and he was telling me about the roofing business tell me about the roofing business and all of a sudden he says oh yeah we also do some general contracting work i was why don't you grow the roofing business he said don't leave money on the table and then this is going to sink in for some of you guys and then and he was i was you've got the roofing you got the gc stuff he's yeah that's what i'm doing he's you pause for a second it's we also flip houses too we fix them and flip them we also do the contracting work but we fixed the roof we get huge costs we're vertically integrated it's dude you're making less three million bucks you're gonna [ __ ] vertical integrated you're distracted and he was how do i scale and i was pick one he's what do you mean i was pick one it's why do you think you can't build a billion dollar roofing business doing roofing and get better at doing roofing he said i don't leave money on the table who here said they don't leave money on the table the money or you were leaving on the table is the focus that you're not giving to the one thing that matters and by the way this is the self-made women list for forbes this is diane hendricks she's the number one wealthiest self-made woman by the way and she owns if you can see it there abc supply which is roofing not housephobic not general contracting work roofing why didn't he build that he's smarter than diane hendricks that's why this is the list and this is what i want you to notice about this this is the forbes the top six for women self-made notice the age of the people on there age is the left column 75 78 84 90 89 63. on the notice the source roofing healthcare software retailing gas stations trucking little caesars pizza i.t sexy the point of this slide is that if you want to build something epic you have to be able to do the same thing for an extended period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are which means if you wanted to not make money this is what you should do number one do lots of different things number two do them for short periods of time don't stick with it too long because you might see success number three do not get help number four make all the mistakes in your own it's the best way to do it because otherwise if you start learning from other people's mistakes you can move faster don't want to do that when you make a mistake do it again repeat it especially if you're i've been here before do the same thing who here knows the definition of learning i'll tell you same condition different behavior if you want to teach someone something and you present them the same condition and they have not changed their behavior they have not learned if you came to this workshop this weekend with the intention of learning something can i get everybody to raise their hand if they had the intention of learning something while they were here if you go back home and your behavior does not change you learned nothing nothing truly took the money and burned it along with losing the output that you lost in the time of here plus travel if that definition has been singed into my mind because if i want to learn something and i have the same condition that's been presented i have to ask myself if i do the same thing again it means i have not learned and i don't want to play this boss again if you do want to make money you can flip it you do one thing for a long period of time you get help from other people you observe what other people have been doing you only make the mistake one time if you are going to make them and you always grow and challenge the beliefs that you had and try and answer the question what do to be true that is not because ordinary business is done for extraordinary time create extraordinary results compounding is the thing it has to compound if the vehicle you are in now does not compound with time then change the vehicle get into something that if you stick with it for an extended period of time it would be unreasonable that you will be poor that was my construction buddy story i had a conversation with a different friend and he had a zillion businesses a zillion i get a spreadsheet for how many businesses he had and they were all [ __ ] businesses they didn't make any money but he had a logo and a website and some va what oh it's a business and he was believing the fallacy of i'm going to wait to see the thing that takes off and then go on on that who here has thought this thought i get it i'm gonna focus i'm gonna wait i'm gonna be patient see which one works out and then because i'm a good statistics guy i'm gonna go with the winning horse but the reality is that any of them could take off you could have a billion dollar roofing business you have a billion dollar gc business you have a billion dollar householding business but you can't have them all you got to focus you gotta pick one and the nice thing is it doesn't matter which one you pick but you do need to pick one the picking is the thing that grows it the ability to say no is the thing that grows it not the thing you pick it's who you are as a consequence of the decision that changes the outcome not the vehicle does that make sense how arrogant is it to think that we can do multiple things at once and compete with someone who's spending all their time on that one thing it's ridiculous and yet we still do it and this is i love this little cartoon this guy he's got all the spinning plates and this is this is me with the red hair going to this guy who's hopefully my competitor and handing him more plays be oh do all that shiny object over there here more plates go i'm going to do this one thing it's my favorite thing in the world competing against somebody who's doing lots of things it's easy to win you don't have to do much because you only have to do a tenth of what they do this is what focus looks one thing all in you can write that down you can circle it one thing all in i asked my friend of mine that had the excel sheet with all these zillions of questions i said if i had a magic wand and i ended all your side projects except for one one the one that you think has the most opportunity the one that's probably making the most money now that you're not paying attention to because it's boring because it's always been doing a while he's yeah i was what business it is he's yeah if you ended everything else because i i have a magic wand i get to make the rules magic wand they all disappear i said how easy would it be to grow that thing he looked at me it's [ __ ] easy i was hmm interesting and he's but that would be hard because of insert real reason that no one gives a [ __ ] about no one cares but i have to fire that uh-huh but i would have to shut down uh-huh but i would have to lay off uh-huh all the riches you want are on the other side of a few hard conversations and most people spend the rest of their lives not having them and being poor and wondering why it's gonna suck it's gonna be that was my number three story the magic wand number four my favorite story who here has seen the matrix awesome you need to become the person who can say no to the woman the red dress the woman in the red dress is the representation of everything that is shiny object and beautiful and wonderful in the world your flavor of woman in the red dress is and and this is something that i have now learned painstakingly is that being able to say no to the one in the red dress changes at levels you can say no to the one in their address who's a crackhead on the corner a thousand bucks a month you're i can say no to her no worries i got something better but then the ten thousand dollar a month girl you're huh interesting and if you're making ten thousand dollars a month it's hard to say no to that girl but let's say that you're a a hard-working discipline [ __ ] you get to a hundred thousand dollars a month there's a hundred thousand dollar a month girl that's an opportunity that is much bigger than the one that you said no to before and you have to learn to flex the muscle at every level this this is a lesson that i learned the hard way i started a supplement company when jim walsh was doing 26 million a year and rather than say oh why don't i take gym launch to 40 next year i'll start another thing gym launch stayed the same and then i added another source of revenue that got us to 37 but it was a mistake strategically i can tell the story it sounds great on paper we sold the company lots of money but it was not the move and i had learned how to say no to a million dollar opportunity a five million a 10 million but i hadn't learned how to say no to a 20 million opportunity when i was making 20 million and the woman in the red dress becomes more seductive more attractive the better you get the more status you get the hotter the girl you attract and i'm saying this figuratively for entrepreneurs does that make sense for everybody who's not into women with red dresses because this is what the woman in the red dress looks ready to smash your [ __ ] and distract you and spread you thin that you can't keep your eye on the ball and then eventually she spreads you thin that you don't know how to get out and it feels quicksand because as soon as you put out fires here there's fires here there's fires here fires here i need more talent you take the best person from over here to fix that problem then this thing goes to [ __ ] how do you get out gotta cut [ __ ] gotta eat your ego you got to watch your revenue go down you can refocus reconsolidate bring the troops in i'm saying this because someone here needs to do this and i wish i had [ __ ] heard this from somebody else i would avoid a lot of pain how do you become that person who can say no to the woman in the red dress you do the activities someone with those character traits would do despite not feeling good about it i'll tell you a story that'll drive us home leila and i were on this walk not that long ago and i said i was i'm impatient i'm impatient i need to be more patient and she was i don't think you're impatient i was yeah i am i [ __ ] hate this let's i want this to be faster i want everything to be bigger faster stronger she's yeah but you're not changing your behavior you feel that way but you haven't done anything that's not aligned with the long-term strategic vision i was yeah but [ __ ] terrible i want to be zen about it he's yeah that's not how it works she's patience is about the behaviors we do not how we feel about behaviors who here has heard the quote courage is not the absence of fear but it's action despite fear patience is not not feeling impatient and feeling terrible about waiting about not jumping on these opportunities it's about not jumping on the opportunities despite feeling [ __ ] about it and wanting to loyalty is not necessarily about the fact that your eye doesn't get caught every once in a while or maybe even feel a desire that you wish you didn't feel it's about what you act on it because who here would rather have somebody you already know where i'm going with this in terms of loyalty how would you rather you'd rather the person not act on the behave on the thought that is how you gain the trait and then over time this is my belief if you do that enough times those feelings go away through exposure therapy you get exposed to this condition over and over again and eventually that you don't die because that's what it feels and whether it's a loyalty issue an integrity issue a courage issue a focus issue which is the point of this message today to become that person you start acting the person who has those beliefs and you behave in that way and then it will sink in want me to their address new distractions kill leverage and keep you poor focus multiplies it i said three things number one how making money works it all comes down to leverage number two why making new stuff is making you poor which means you have to focus and number three is why better is leverage this is the make money part here's a simple approach to growth that we use with our portfolio companies better is better than new better is leverage because remember leverage is how we get more from what we put in if you do it better you get more for what you put in that is leverage examples if you have call scripts if you make content if you have websites that you're building if you have follow-up sequences if you have offers if you do the current thing you get what you currently have if you make it better you will get more from the activities you can create leverage in your business by being better and better comes from boring most of us solved an emotional need by quitting we were doing to start to become an entrepreneur and then we had a positive reinforcement from that from that behavior and then we learned that as a way of life but the problem is that the thing that forced you or gave you that emotional that decrease your action threshold thus that you would jump into the next thing is the thing that'll make you jump out of the opportunity that could become your billion dollar thing does that make sense you felt uncomfortable on your job you quit your job you got rewarded and you think oh when i quit things i'll get rewarded but that's the wrong lesson it only works once and then you have to unlearn it and with each level of entrepreneurship there are lessons that that you have to unlearn the thing that got you there better comes from boring it is not exciting to run your 38th split test on a landing page it does make you more money it comes from doing all the [ __ ] that you should be doing but aren't and now this is an activity this is an active part imagine a list of all the stuff you should be doing but aren't doing now within your existing business now top of your head there's some [ __ ] that you should be doing in your business i'm going to give you 15 seconds the reason that stuff is important is because you already know what you need to do and we come here get raw rod etc but the [ __ ] is on your desk at home that is the work that must be done it needs doing and most of us know what to do and we don't want to confront it because we want to do something more stimulating and exciting that makes us feel alive and your business doesn't give a [ __ ] better is boring and better gets you more for what you put in better as leverage now imagine who here has a few businesses be [ __ ] hard to make that list wouldn't it there's too much [ __ ] it's too much too much stuff to make the business which means becomes impossible which means that's why you have to pick one because there is much stuff that has to be done to do one business do it if you do it you grow by default there's a promise who here is i know i should be doing more email follow-up i know i should be calling my leads within five minutes who here thinks that now let me ask a different question and many of you did raise your hand who here calls other leads within five minutes two hands you will triple your sales triple triple who wants to triple the [ __ ] business triple but that sounds boring sure is gotta implement crm got to get round robin set up lee's got to come in you got to figure out how call prioritization works between the team that's boring makes you a shitload of money that's how it works who's going to win two different businesses the guys who got the [ __ ] dialed better gets you more for what you put in and when you do get home order it from the amount you have to put in to get the thing done that will result in the most output and start taking them off and you continue to ignore the new things that sound exciting and you become the person who's able to do that by pretending to be the person who's able to do that because you already know what to do this is a mental model i a lot who here has ever had a coach or a mentor has anyone ever coached or mentored other people does anyone feel they're a better mentor than they are a person who does [ __ ] i do all the time and is i ask myself this question it's been one of the most profound most helpful questions i've had which is if i were coaching me and the beautiful thing about this is that when you coach you you have no other agenda you're trying to help you and you also have more information than anyone else has you've been on every conversation you've been you've read every email you've seen every report if you were coaching you now what would you tell you to do and what's crazy about this is that half the [ __ ] time is not what i'm doing coach me much smarter than mimi mumu take your own advice if you do that i promise you'll make more money be but i'm a special snowflake you're convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are giving yourself reasons that reality does not apply to you it does and this is a boss level you might need to keep going against the snowflake until eventually you figure out that you got to melt it by being there and hanging in and in my entrepreneurial career there's two periods clear definitions of periods of time in my life the first period was when i was distracted this is when i did not make money i had six gyms i had a launch business return we do gym turnarounds in person that's where i physically was not at my gyms i had a dentist a dental agency i had a chiropractor agency i had something else more lots of fingers and i was 26 ish and i would love to tell people oh i own nine companies i'm poor but but it felt good struck my ego not my bank account it was only one layla the angel of my life it was hey this one makes us the most money and you spend the least amount of time on it that jim launch thing works but i have to i would have to sell all those gyms i'd have to end partnerships i'd have to let go of people in the agency and she was yeah or you could keep doing what you're doing clearly working point taking and over the next 90 days i sold five gyms shut one down shut down both agencies and got rid of everything and 12 months later from that moment we were doing one and a half million a month from zero and and 12 months after that we had four and a half million a month one thing and this was the second period focus it's much easier to stack the deck in your favor if you do one thing because when you focus on one thing you make it unreasonable to fail if you do one thing for an extended period of time it becomes unreasonable to suck if you do it more than anyone else has done it you'll be better than that is what it is people watch all the time they're hey how did you get good at sales i took four thousand [ __ ] sales calls that's how i did it i did it i didn't even i'd even go through a sales training at four thousand [ __ ] conversations that's why i did it and if you if you wanted to be the best salesman in the world then have more sales conversations than anyone else has if you want to be the best real estate investor then do more deals than anyone else has and the sub the subsequent before that is send out more mailers than anyone else has have more cold callers than anyone else has send more cold dms than anyone else has and you'll become the best and if you put that as the output the thing that you're looking at it becomes unreasonable that you would be not the best you're at least going to be top 10. and if who here would be top 10 in real estate in the us would you be with that it wouldn't be bad and that everyone fails because they want to move fast this is the number one issue they don't have a solid foundation they draw the dotted line they think i'm going to try and shortcut it i'm not going to fix my product i'm not going to make it good because i want to go fast because i want to show to my friends that i'm growing every month i wonder how good i am it's a short game how many times it's it's the restaurant example is simple many people start a restaurant slap two pieces of wonder bread together put a slice of bologna in there and then market it [ __ ] crazy and they're dude i don't get why my business isn't growing i'm because everyone who has your food tells everyone that it [ __ ] sucks and never come back there's this invisible hand that works against people which is who knows about the power of word of mouth the invisible hand who here runs ads let me ask that question who runs advertisement if you run ads and it has become more expensive for you disproportionate to the increase in cpms which is cost for impression or eyeballs in that period of time that you've been in business then it means that you have negative word of mouth if you're i don't get that many referrals oh but you sure do get a whole bunch of people who you get negative referrals you get negative sales you have to spend twice as much of a car customer because every other customer that you would have acquired was told by someone else not to buy from you it's the invisible hand when you shortcut it promote promote promote and then flatline and then dissolve and then you come up with new [ __ ] and you who here has seen the people on the internet doing this game over and over and over again they don't get the product they put two pieces of baloney sandwiched together with a baloney slice in the middle and they call it a product and then we have ham with one slice in the middle and it's still [ __ ] because they don't want to take the 12 months to get the [ __ ] product but on the long game 10 years from now the guy who takes the first year takes a break even on that year to get the product makes everything easy but no one can wait 12 months because they can't see the big picture they keep trying to string three of these little shortcuts together rather than build the foundation better is leverage better gets you more for what you put in this is what small businesses look this is what big businesses look the amount of activity is not that different it's a line it's all in the same direction it's all it is it's not i promise you've been in both it's all it is there's nothing there's no magic it's a windup same input more output boring but better looks it means split testing landing pages not once but weekly not one time when you come here you put the process in place to do it every [ __ ] week split testing emails not once but weekly making new ads and creative not when you have to but before you need them role playing with the sales team not once but daily role playing with customer success hey i want a refund hey i hated this hey it wasn't fast enough what did they say role play if you have amazing customer success they role played every day they'll get [ __ ] good i promise how exciting is that not at all not at all but what it does it makes more money taking 10 more interviews for the same role sucks to talk to 10 more people for no reason but there is a reason because you're trying to find the one person that's going to give you 10 times the leverage on that time you got back think about this but if you didn't take those interviews you hire someone wait six months and you have to do the whole thing again and you lost the six months that's what layla was talking about taking more time to make your lead magnet better make your offer better and better all these things are boring but make you more money and this is my promise is that doing all the un60 [ __ ] that you aren't doing but no you should is the secret to the success my promise if you do nothing new but only what you already know you should be doing that your self coach tells you to you will make more money in the next 12 months than you can imagine you got to do it this is a text i got yesterday or yeah it was yesterday this guy had lost everything and he had set a goal down for himself and he said hey last day of 2021 set a business goal that's always unrealistic impossible to hit i'm going to surpass it in q3 and the only thing that i told him to do was to commit to the activities i was do the same thing every day rain or shine it was prospect i was a prospect every day he's and the first few months he had a couple good months and then he slowed down he's how do i say how do i stay committed i was because you felt successful for [ __ ] getting an outcome it's irrelevant for who you are some of you guys have heard this quote but your work works on you more than you work on it i was you need to become the person who isn't satisfied with that outcome was but only by the commitment that you made to yourself about the activity that you were going to do and whether it was up or it was down it divorces the actions from the outcome not to say that the outcome is not the work it is but in terms of who you are who you are is is forged in the repetitive act final point who here knows the difference between a seven out of 10 book and a nine and a half out of ten book about 20 times the work realistically who you knows the difference in sales between seven and a half book and a nine and a half book about a thousand times the sales and if you do 20 times the work and get a thousand times the effort that's a 50x increase per unit of input it's a lot it's worth it but you do have to do 20 times more work that is leverage an opportunity is missed by most because the distressed and overalls and looks work and i said i was going to cover three things and i have a little thing at the end here it'll take me less than five you guys go with that all sweet i said i was going to cover three things i want to make sure i filled my promise number one is how making money works leverage everybody feel good with that does that make sense all number two why making new [ __ ] is making you poor and while you have to focus number three is why better is leverage awesome and i want to wrap up my presentation with a quick demonstration of leverage in the real world getting more out of the same thing we're gonna do an exercise to wrap this up and that it will do more than anything i can say with these slides this will probably be what you remember unfortunately with all my picture pictures i'm going to take a single action and increase the leverage in real time in front of you is that cool you'll see a before and after in front of your eyes it's a real world money magic trick i gave you a lot of examples of things you can improve in a business better cause better content better sales groups better website better follow-up better offers what i'm going to do is i'm going to highlight one of these things all for you now and show you how many riches lie unlocked within your business today that you already know about i'm going to focus on offers because it's an easy one i can do in front of everyone all i'm going to show you the leverage of a better offer i'm going to sell you a book for a hundred thousand dollars kidding a thousand dollars the point of leverage is a better offer sorry the point is leverage of a better offer one action selling one product a book leverage is how much money it fetches for the same activity does that make sense our equation this makes sense here are the directions for this activity the moment you feel that a thousand dollars of value has been created please stand up and stay standing does this make sense this is simple directions if you feel a thousand dollars then stand and stay standing all i'm repeating it 100 000 kidding typa let the leverage building begin i have 10 books with me today who wants one for a thousand dollars raise your or stand up thank you stay standing three people already have three thousand dollars is this exciting all i'd even tell you what it was yet it's a good book probably giving it away who now wants it i said it was a good book no more people it's a best seller still three people oh four there we go four people haha it's my book now i got one more two more three more all four more we got eight nine ten eleven i've already accounted for my books but wait there's more i said who wants one of the ten for a thousand we got all these cool there's all the reviews people say it's good good rating please stay standing it's also number one number four and number seven for the last 13 straight months cool in marketing and sales it's dope please stand up this guy read the book and quadrupled his monthly revenue from reading the book if you quadruple your revenue would that be worth it oh yeah six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve a lot more this is it wow probably 40 or 50 up but wait there's more going to autograph the book there's only one that i have autographed that's not true there's probably five oops i had to get a fat marker you could sit that's my my it's embarrassing not yet not yet not yet not yet oh you got to stand you got to keep standing got to keep standing one out of ten i'll put my personal cell phone in the inside thousand bucks i'm not gonna show it to you all we got about two-thirds i'm gonna review for your sales calls rewrite your script with you and drill your sales team on how we set everything up does that work for a thousand bucks stand if that's worth it for you with the book please stand i'll have my traffic guy who now we get about 20 000 leads a day across our portfolio he'll do an entire funnel breakdown to see about 11 pages he'll break down everything that you could do differently within the funnel different headline split tests different paragraphs different copy things different images different layouts now we have between more than 2x but confident saying we can double your traffic all we're close we're 90 percent i'll also use my network to recruit the one missing star player that you have in your company now we will look at your company and we'll find out what the biggest missing pieces in leverage and put someone in there for you stand up with that that's worth a thousand bucks i'll also spend two hours with you on the offer that you're giving now you can get more people to click more people to sign up for the calls more people to show more people to buy and at higher prices all i got one person still seated i got i see you i see you i see what i got i'll see what i got see what i got i'm also going to feature you on my channel that two hours will televise it and we'll distribute it across all of our channels now that gets about 10 million impressions in real advertising dollars it's about a hundred thousand dollars in advertising for in terms of that's what people are willing to pay for three 90 second spots and it's a 30 minute spot it would be significantly higher than that if that's worth a thousand bucks let me know by standing is how you do that and if you don't make three times what you pay me for this book i'll give you all the money back and keep all the work that we did that work measured over 12 months that's the fine print fair please stand if that's still worth a thousand bucks i see you and there's not 10 books there's only one look around and that's how you increase leverage to sell and offer set for 25 buckets for a hundred thousand dollars does everyone understand stay standing do you ever understand that you need to do it better output comes from volume times leverage you must do more and get more from what you do the way you get more from what you do is you first do everything that you should be doing better the way you do that is to focus on one thing for a long time without distraction anything can become big with time when you line all actions to a single outcome and you keep working at it your success will look effortless and obvious from the outside but you will know that it came from years of saying no to everything except that which mattered most this is how we grow companies at acquisition.com through leverage most entrepreneurs the who the what and how to scale at acquisition.com we recruit the who we give them the what we show them the how and once an entrepreneur has all three the business scales by default laila already showed you these we've got more free courses at acquisition.com if you guys this stuff if you want to learn more from us and that's it thank you guys much i appreciate you [music] transcript ======================================== i've been in business for 13 years i've sold nine companies my last company i sold for 46.2 million i own acquisition. comom which now does about $17 million a month across our portfolio i'm going to compress 13 years of brutal business truths and lessons into this one video brutal business truth number one sell to rich people until you have the money to sell all the poor people the middle is where you get killed elon said you can either do a lot of good for a small amount of people or a little good for a large amount of people and i will tell you personally it's way hard to do a little good for a lot of people than a lot of good for a small amount of people there is a reason that tesla started at the top they started only selling to rich people they had the roadster which was $250,000 and they sold those and then he was able to go down market one and sell $100,000 cars to upper ash line of society the wealthy and then after that he made the x which is a little bit cheaper than that and then underneath of that he made the model 3 which was going to be the mass model and each time it was significantly harder to do the one before because if if you want to sell based on value in terms of low cost you need to build the infrastructure for huge amounts of demand because the only way that you make money selling to poor people is selling tons and tons and tons of them look at walmart look at amazon these are businesses that were built for volume day one and they win on efficiency that was the whole point amazon he wanted to have the best selection and the lowest prices walmart everyday low prices they want they win on efficiencies they all fly coach they use fold out cheairs they drink out of paper cups they purposely breed the culture of efficiency because it's the only way that you can win if you sell to poor people and i say poor people to be hyperbolic in terms of my language that it drives the point home obviously i buy from amazon but the point is is that the strategy is based on volume and you've probably heard some of my other tweets around this which is solve rich people problems they pay better or if you solve rich people problems you get to charge rich people prices this is what the key insight is is that to someone who only has $11,000 when they pay you $100 they pay you 10% of their net worth their expectations of what they're going to get for that $100 is the same as a rich person giving you 10 million of their $100 million it would be gigantic in terms of their expectations but getting a rich person to give you $100 they might have you notice and is that it's easier in some ways to solve rich people problems because they're willing to pay more in an absolute sense for lower relative value and with that extra profit or gross margin you can absolutely overd deliver for them and still make money and not have to learn all these things with infrastructure for example if i wanted to start a bank i would have to have $25 to $100 million to start it up but if you do that then you have to build the infrastructure that you can handle money for zillions and zillions and zillions of people a hard business to get into and the idea is that you want to sell at least this is my belief is that you want to sell premium you want to sell s to wealthy people you want to sell to a niche person that you can do a lot of good for in a small slice because you don't have to compete against everyone you can have inefficiencies and still make money without having to have tremendous infrastructure and skill around building it once you make a ton of money doing that you can obviously do more of that which big fan or you say what the next thing i do i want to do for zillions and zillions of people and then you build a business a netflix that think about how insane netflix is as a concept you pay $13 or $15 a month or it is now and they create movies and shows and they spend millions of dollars and they sign comedians and they've got all these shows that are streaming and you pay $14 a month it's absurd think about if you were said hey mom and dad i want to start this video subscription and i'm going to pay millions of dollars to get all these shows and movies made for us and i'm going to charge 14 bucks it would be absurd that's how much value you have to provide to someone who doesn't have money to capture huge slices of the market how are you going to beat prime $99 a year or 129 a year it is now and with prime you get all netflix with prime video you also have next day shipping same day shipping with anything that you want to buy 99 bucks a year $129 a year if you build to sell to the masses you need to build you're going to sell to the masses and you're usually going to have to put a ton of money in for a long period of time because you have to have that infrastructure upfront to deal with that volume to have such a crazy value discrepancy that someone who has no money still never wants to cancel that's the key whereas if you go to wealthier people you can get a premium you can have five clients that all pay you $5,000 a month and make an amazing income and have the resources to do a good job and hire a couple people to help you out who are competent and you can do that when you charge more money and those people are not the ones who are and everybody's hurt seen this me where the $50 month customer is hey for this $50 a month what am i going to get now we make fun of that that's the reality of if you're taking 5% of someone's paycheck it means a lot to them whereas if you're going to somebody who's making a million a month and they pay you five grand if they get one good thing a year they're stoked and they're oh yeah i sent the wire did you get it the difference between working with somebody who's on the lower end versus the higher end and being clear about who you serve not not serving other people going down market only if you have the infrastructure to support huge amounts of volume and usually the capital to front it either you build for volume day one and win on efficiency amazon or walmart or you build for a premium which means you niche down and you completely solve problems for people you completely solve a problem in a narrow niche and let me give you a completely polar opposite examples here which i live on both sides of the spectrum on one side acquisition. comom is my premium brand this is the brand that we do deals with this is where we have hundred million companies that we invest in that we own in that's my family office and we do one or two deals a year to being real we make rich people way wealthier that's what i do there someone comes in is already worth 50 million bucks and we're cool how do we get to 250 and that's what we invest in that's what we we scale the company on the other extreme we've got school school is for everyone who's starting out now school took 5 years to get to the level of product that it is now and millions and tens of millions of dollars of development where it lost money the entire time and still loses money now in order to create such an absurd value for the 99 bucks a month or it is because we know that that $99 a month for somebody who's trying to start their business that's the entirety of their business budget and we have to solve all of the business problems that those people have at that level and these are two completely this the most polar extremes of value creation in terms of who we're selling to or who we advertise to and who we're attracting and how we help them and there's no coincidence that i did acquisition. comom before investing in being a co-owner of school because i had to make enough money to be able to afford to sell to people who don't have much to be able to to help build the infrastructure and invest millions of dollars to build that that we could accommodate millions and millions of users now we have many millions of users on the the platform if you are confused about how to sell rich people stuff first off the easiest hack for selling a rich people is do what somebody else is doing that sells to rich people and do it in half the time and charge twice the price number one rich people pay for time above all else but if we look at the value equation you've got the outcom you got to make sure they want the outcome that you're promising and you got the three other variables you've got risk how likely is it that they're going to get what they want when they buy time delay between when they buy and when they get and the effort sacrifice the richer they are the more guaranteed they want it to be now you don't have to guarantee things but you need the perception of the guarantee that's why reputation matters if you're the best plastic surgeon in the world you don't give a guarantee they have a high perceived likely of achievement they believe that if they pay you the likely that their nose isn't up when they do the surgery is high if time delay they want it to be as fast as possible if they give you money and have it tomorrow rich people pay a lot of money for that and then you've got effort and sacrifice i don't want to do anything i want you to do everything and is that a lot of times that makes sense to have white glove concierge high touch things for people who are willing to pay for it because for them the incremental difference in cost for them is small the difference between $5,000 a month and $10,000 a month to a multi-millionaire not a huge difference but if you're better for $10,000 a month they'll happily pay you than the $5,000 a month guy you're not going to sell someone who's wealthy on how much money you're going to save them you'll sell someone who's wealthy on how much time you're going to save them brutal business truth number two you lack priorities not information problems are easy to solve if what you're after if what problem you're trying to solve i'll tell you a story i was talking to an entrepreneur who's done about 10 million a year and that was between all of his companies and we were talking and he mentioned one and then he mentioned the second they mentioned the third they mentioned the fourth i was dude how many companies do you have and he's oh i don't know i was you don't know he's yeah i have an excel sheet and i was pull it up and he pulled up his excel sheet and he had 56 companies that in total were making $10 million a year and obviously one of them was the biggest one that was doing half of that revenue and that was the company that i had heard of that that he that he found it i said dude if you only had that one company how easy would it be to 5x that business he was oh my god if i didn't have these other 55 companies it'd be it'd be a joke i was if i waved to magic w and that happened you think you could do it and he was yeah and i was then do it you can wave the magic wand you can end these other 55 partnerships that you can do this one thing and what's crazy is that a year later i talked to him and he had done that he was dude i didn't sleep for three days after we talked because i was oh my god that's it i see strategy as priority it's priorization of resources you have unlimited options you have limited resources time money people etc and how you choose to allocate those resources against the unlimited options is your strategy it is how you prioritize and and when you have one clear goal for one clear company for one clear customer the prioritization gets easy and a lot of people keep looking for these unique insights when the reality is you don't even have a goal have you toine the problem that you're trying to solve and most people have it and that ends up being usually the first question i ask someone they're hey i'm stuck with my business and i say what's the goal and then they say something they say what problem are you solving now and if you can't clearly state current state desired state obstacle you're running around a chicken with your head cut off you're not going to solve anything you're going to do a lot of work but you're not going to move forward i had a media company approach me they've got 40 million subscribers across their channels obviously good at media they said hey we've been listening to your content and we think that our constraint the problem that we need to solve that will get us the most bang for the buck is that we need to optimize our sops for the media company i said what's the goal i was is it to get more famous or is it to money and they're no we want to we want to shift into monetization now i was let me ask you this what product do you sell and they were we don't have a product i was hear me out crazy idea if you had a product you would make a lot more money than trying to get your 97 out of 100 media company to 98 and a half not to say that there's nothing if they said i want to be more famous then i would have said absolutely you should do that that makes sense because monetization is in the goal but if they were trying to make money they had nothing to sell and i promise you if you have nothing to sell you make a lot less money than if you do have something to sell and they could be a two out of 10 on product but with that amount of media that amount of traffic they would be able to get many sales that they would they would blow it out of the water and they were spending all this time trying to get in the intricacies trying to get information on how to solve the wrong problem and most times it's not that you lack insight it's that you're solving the wrong thing and the reason that that happens frequently is because those entrepreneurs are media entrepreneurs they media they feel comfortable in media and they solving media problems and they solving problems that they know how to solve because they've solved them before i'll tell you a different story i had a guy who came out for a workshop here at acquisition. comom and he said hey can you go over the closer framework and i said you flew across the country you've been here for a day you had this one opportunity to ask this question to me i was is sales a problem in your business what's your clos rate he said 40% i said sales is not the constrain of your business he was no i was then why are you asking me about the closure framework and i think that that lesson was way more powerful than me trying to go over the closure framework because the reality is is he was a sales guy he loves selling and he wanted to hear me talk about sales but sales isn't the problem in his business there's something else that's the problem he might not getting enough leads or people are turning out to to cl on the background or he can't even take on more customers because he doesn't have enough team those were all other examples of problems that might exist and i'll bet you one of those three probably is the problem his business but that was the question he asked he asked about the thing that he enjoyed reading about the thing he enjoyed learning about and now if you're an entrepreneur it is true that you want to double down your strengths but the business as a whole has to be balanced hear me out if you think about business a a body and you're a bodybuilder and you want to have ideal ratios for everything in terms if your arms were this big and your your quads were tiny then you look weird you want to be a specialist you sure as an individual contributor keep doubling down in your strengths but the business as a whole will only be as strong as as weakest link and this is where people get confused with double down in your strength versus be balanced the business needs to be balanced your physique in total needs to be balanced but you as an individual contributor can double down your strengths you want a team of people who are all doubling down on their strengths but you as the organizer of the business need to make sure that the business as a whole is balanced otherwise it will get constrained at some point and then that point will be your point of failure that will be the weak link that will be the part of the bridge where only $1 can get across even you've got 10x the front end and 10x the back end that one bottleneck is what's bottlenecking the business and making sure that often times the thing that you're not the most excited if you're a marketing entrepreneur marketing is probably not your problem if you're a product driven entrepreneur product's probably not your problem if you hate people and that's that's probably your issue i hate meetings i hate leading people i hate trying to reinvest my team i'll bet you that you probably are having limits on your business because you don't know how to recruit higher train manage and that's what you need to either learn or recruit someone who already knows how to do that and people spend too much time mentally masturbating to the concepts that they love in the idea that because it worked to get them to where they're at because they needed to start marketing to make money they think now if i 10x marketing that that's what it takes to make more money and unless that's the constraint that's not true and often times businesses do grow to the constraint of the founder they do grow to the constraint of that individual founders highly special i skill and then at that point it's constrained with something else that the founder doesn't as much and either you got to learn it and get comfortable learning stuff that you don't as much initially or you got to find someone who does and if you're i'm either a product entrepreneur and i need more marketing or i'm a market entrepreneur and i need more product or i'm either of those things and we don't have an operator we have somebody who likes to lead and manage people and invest in teams then how do what good looks first off one of the biggest advantages of business of of doing this for a while is to you start to recognize patterns you hire five guys that suck and then finally find a six then all of a sudden you're this is what a good sales director look this is why the businesses for example that we start now grow much faster because one we know who's going to be needed next and two we know what that person looks and think about how much time you save where if the constraint let's say is sales and you hire onboard train and that takes a month and then that person sucks and it takes you 6 months to fire them and then you do it again and that takes another 6 months to fire them and you do it again and then this time it works you wait wasted a year and change of growth that you should have been growing but you weren't because you're the wrong person at the point of constraint and realistically this is why many businesses get stuck and the wrong conclusion is the person says oh i tried hiring sales directors that doesn't work no you tried hiring john and jn sucked it doesn't mean that there is no sales director doesn't mean you're the special snowflake that no one can ever replace you that no one can do this role it's that you can't there's microsoft there's facebook there are gazillion dollar companies someone out there on earth is better than you at the thing that you're best at and definitely better than the thing that you suck at now how do you tactically find these people when you don't have the experience i'll give you the the tactic how about this one is i interview lots of people and if you think about the interview process as an education process in asking them as much as you possibly can act an ignoramus be i don't know anything about this tell me about it and then don't then immediately jump on the first person go on 10 dates go on 20 dates i'll give you a little sideline story for school say i'm the founder interviewed 600 developers before he found his co-founder 600 and the way that he did that is the process of him outlining first he said hey who here knows anything about development in his network he got he started interviewing those developers and then he said hey can you introduce me to the best developers and then those people introduced him because they had a better context he's i'm not hiring any of you i want to know the best people and eventually he kept going up the ladder of he talked to those people say who's who's the best one and he kept going up and kept going up only to fact find only to find information until he found somebody who's oh my gosh this guy said more things and made more sense and at this point in the process he'd already spoken to many people he had a good context from which to make a judgment and that is the process i will tell you what i personally look for now i look for the quantity and quality of metrics that someone has to describe their role and i'll give you a binary example on one hand if i was hiring someone for customer success let's say that's you're getting a lot of churn you're not getting a lot of ascensions you're not getting good reviews your nps scores are low etc you then saying mr customer success candidate tell me about customer success what metrics do you measure now if they say i want to make sure people are happy that they're having a good a good time and that they're they're getting results and they're having a good experience i'd be cool what do you measure and if they start squirming around what do you measure and they can only come up with one or two things then already know that this person obviously can't drive an outcome because they can't even define an outcome now on the flip side if that person says we to define an activation metric up front that we can do within the first 48 hours then we have what is our time to value and what's our what's our north star there we also to measure cstat but i don't to do it too often because then customers don't filling out the surveys and we want to make sure that we can do it ideally within the customer journey during a value driven exchange that they're going to have with the customer service rep or some account rep that they have to manage and then we can tack it into that process i to look at churn but but churn i see more as a lagging indicator and i looked at look at these other things especially what's our time how long does it take from sale to onboarding what's that handoff look what percentage of customers are backing out in the first 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours and what percentage of these customers are leaving us review by day 30 and all of a sudden i'm he said nine different metrics and had reasoning for that and then the followup to this question of understanding the quality and quanity of the metrics that someone's going to bring to the table is awesome this is going to freak some people out how does what you do make the business money and if the person cannot accurately describe how their function because every function of a business makes a business money that's why the function exists now is that some functions of a business are indirect versus direct if i asked a cfo how do you make the business money they should say multiple things one i control expenses everything that i save goes to the bottom line and i have a process of consistently cutting out access costs every 30 days and by doing that i can usually drive an extra 3 to five % to the bottom line which more than pays for me i'm great they're already even thinking about my return as an owner versus them on top of that they say also i see finance as a function of decision-making and if we can collect the metrics that drive decisions around what things have the highest gross margins what's our utilization rates how can we make the decisions that will get us the highest return on capital both human and money capital in the business then we will grow faster and if someone talks that then i'm they understand how finance is a data function by the way it is that's what finance does is gives you reports it's reporting that you can make decisions about the business that they we make more money cool now sales is say and i'll give you an example for a sales director if i say hey how does what you do make us more money now if they say i'm going to i'm going to drive sales i'd be duh but you're not going to sell anyone cu you're a director how do you make the company more money what you want them to say is that i'm going to increase the average conversion percentage across our leads for the team because that is the output of the sales manager is closing percentage at a fundamental rate it's closing percentage is one of the metrics but total conversion rate of leads if i get 100 leads and there's lots of mini steps you got to schedule you got to show you got to close you got to offer there's cash collected there's other mini metrics along the way but you want to see what percentage of eyeballs ind oror earballs and people who give us their information we can contact do we convert into sales and if you say i as a sales director will be able to increase that percentage then that's the job and that's how i make the business more money because here's the thing if they cannot describe an output of their job that ties to revenue for the business or ties to profit for the business then you can be absolutely certain that they don't know how to do it and that they're not going to do it for you because they can't even tell you how it works and i use those as the limit test test one i interview as many people as i possibly can i can get a basis from which to make a judgment two from there i'll learn the metrics because i won't know them that people use to describe the role to drive outcomes and i will look for the quantity and quality of metrics that people will track and what they would do to influence those metrics step two and then step three how does what you do make the company more money don't let them get away with with the sales example we're going to make more sales no but how do you influence that business truth number three things are hard because your team isn't as good as you think they are and that's because your standards are too low a metro mind said this to me and i've always kept this in mind he said your best talent you haven't even hired yet your best talent is in the future and let's run a thought experiment for a second everybody who's listening to this has that one teammate who's an absolute stud hopefully if you don't i'm sorry for you but at least one person on your team is good if you had to those people would you be able to make way more money the answer is almost always unequivocally yes i'd be able to make way more money and then the followup is then why is all of your attention not to getting more of those people if you listen to the steve jobs the boses the the bill gates elon many of them zuckerberg many of them talk about talent and in the early days of entrepreneurship i thought that they were trying to hide the secrets but it's that they were talking about what they were focused on now and as i continue to do business the more i care about who rather than what or how because if you do have the who you're one higher away from somebody who's a 100 times smarter than you who's done this way longer than you have who can help you grow the business i'll give you this story that drove this home when we were looking at selling gym launch we had a lot of conversations with investment bankers and then finally fixed we picked an investment bank to represent us and then we had a lot of conversation with prospective buyers acquires meaning people who fund managers people who have big funds of money who buy companies for a living and i remember a moment on one of the first of these meetings where i it was it was in person they'd flown out and all of their team was on one side and all of my team was on the other and i was sitting at the head and the managing partner was at the other side of the table and i remember sitting there silently looking down the table looking at both sides back and forth back and forth and being no wonder these guys are going to make $3 billion in the next five years versus my team and to be clear it wasn't that my team was bad we built a $100 million doll plus business i saw the discrepancy this is not a slight to anybody on the team we obviously had stars but seeing the average level of talent on their team versus mine was a huge moment for me to understand how important people are and there's a story in google it was larry page surgery brand whoever typed into google parachutes and the ads that came up were for buy a radio buy a car and he screenshotted it and he puts it on the corkboard in the engineering room and said these ads suck he wrote it on the screenshot and he hit the board and he walked out of the room and the story goes that the next night one of the developers stayed up all night and came up with adsense and adsense more closely paired what people were searching for with the ads that they were shown he didn't say here's the 100 step proc process that we're going to do to solve this problem he said you guys are intelligent this is the problem go fix it and one of the telltale signs that you have bad people on your team or people who are too dumb or your standards are too low is that you have stupid rules and i and i i'm i'm i'm somebody who's done this this isn't me preaching here this is something that i've i've now realized is that if you have to have a rule that's hey everybody you have to show up on time hey don't drink while you're on the job hey you can't watch netflix while you're working that's not a good thing by the way all of these are rules that i have implemented at some time in a business that i've owned and i'm telling you this now because it seems painfully obvious that if i have to say don't watch netflix while you're on a customer service call with a customer that shouldn't be a rule that should be an obvious thing that anyone with half a brain cell can figure out but what that meant is that if you start making stupid rules it's because your standards are too low and you're hiring stupid people people rule number four lots of rules means you have dumb people let's talk about that for a second one of the things to prevent against this is a rule from amazon which is that every person you hire you want to raise the average bar of the team that they're getting hired into i used this yesterday with someone that we were interviewing lelo was what do you think about this person i said do they raise the bar of the team and he was hm i was all then there's our answer because is that all companies will unless controlled for dilute down talent people sixes will hire fives five will hire his four fours will hire threes and people will always hire people that they're not threatened from because they want security first and you have to implement something this because the reverse can also be true if imagine if every single time you hired somebody it raised the bar of the team then the team will continue to get better and better and smarter and smarter people and then the company will grow and grow and grow and i have a fundamental bel that the level of a business grows a christmas tree where you've got the the number and intelligence of brains that goes up if you have lots and lots and lots of intelligent brains the the size of this business is huge if you only have one brain that's intelligent and everyone underneath of that has a subset of the skills of that one brain then it's only one brain that's competing against companies that have a 100 smart brains and that was something that in my early days every person i hired i could do their job better than them and i trained them to do everything they did which meant the limit of the business was me i had to keep learning things which you always have to do of course but i had to learn everything from scratch and the business then had to suffer what a a day one customer success rep would deal with because i didn't know anything about customer success and the idea is i would rather bring someone in who has 10 years of experience in customer success that we can start the business on year 10 of customer success i want that person who have learned all those lessons on someone else's dollar and then when they come to me have all those lessons i don't need the scars and one of the one of the telltale sides also of an early company is that you've got people who have zero experience in leadership roles for a function they've never done before and that's because it's this is my coo sarah we have five people in our company but she's our coo it's don't use the term coo cu she's going to look at salary.com and she's going to say that she she make more than the entire company makes in revenue no that's not the case she's a manager and realistically she probably doesn't manage the whole business she probably manages this portion of it or he manages a portion of it and is because it's your mom or it's your brother or your best friend growing up or that guy who you hired first has been with you since the beginning it still doesn't mean that they're for the role and this is where a lot of the money that you want to make is on the other side of a few hard conversations and many people never have they're willing to accept mediocrity at the point of the bottleneck and never get debottleneck because they can't say hey sarah i don't think it's working out and it's my fault because i put you in a position without the resources to win and and this is how you this is how i manage it what i want to do is i want to keep investing in you and here's how i want to do it i want to bring someone in who has a ton of experience who knows more than both of us put together and i want you i'm going to pay for you to learn from this person that you can become more skilled in your career and then you i want you to get laser focused on this thing over here that you were doing before and absolutely tune it up and this way we you're going to crush what you're currently doing every day and it's absolutely within your scope and experience that you can do with it and i also want to build out your future by bringing this person in think about it me paying $100,000 a year for you to learn from somebody who has 10 years of experience it's about the biggest gift i can give you and if you frame it that it's not this is a demotion or you suck it's i'm trying to invest in you and i'm going to invest in you by bringing this person in who's going to teach you now if that person has an ego which is usually the next common thing which is i thought i was doing great then it means you probably have a communication issue you're not telling them that sarah's not doing a good job and then sarah gets upset and is at that point sarah might have an ego because she started at the front line and then became a manager then you give her another title progression too fast and to be clear i've done this two times with executive assistants with executive assistant within the companies a zillion times me personally i've done this and i don't even deal with a lot of personnel in general and it's i i promoted someone too fast it's the peter principle which is that people will advance to their point of incompetency and someone does at sales and then you put them in a sales manager and then they've never managed a sales team and they don't do at that but they get promoted to their point of incompetence i lost a good salesperson and i got a bad sales manager and this is how most of corporations are run people do and then their role changes into something they've never done before and then they do poorly and they get stuck there or they get fired and most times because the person who promoted them feels bad they get stuck there and you' got all these people who you still have positive associations with the work that they did and you feel you owe them because they did do a good job one time before but now they're doing a poor job because they're not properly equipped and you didn't give them the skills to succeed and they don't have the experience and yes that's your fault but you can't fire you because you own the company somebody's got a and either you got to move them aside you redefine the role and move someone ahead of them or you have to get rid of them and again this is what makes business hard it's not that it's complicated it's that you don't want to hurt someone's feelings and i get that that's what makes hard conversations hard if you hate somebody firing them is easy someone stole from you firing is not personal experience there slept fine that night all it's the conversation with someone that is trying their best that you as a human being but isn't cutting it and even if you think you could get them there you're not willing to invest the resource to do it because it doesn't make sense i could wait for someone to learn neurosurgery and people could but it might take a decade and i don't know if i want to invest all that time when i could go find a neurosurgeon and yeah i might have to pay more but i'd rather pay that than pay 10 years and to to to to loop this back around to the story that i was talking with the private equity firmers when i was looking at them one of the big ob things too is that many of the people on the other side of the table were making 1 million2 million $5 million a year and people who were in their 20s making 300,000 500,000 a year and i was i need to reset my bar of what i have to compensate in order to attract a level talent and once i understood the value of people the way that we grew businesses completely changed it stopped being about building businesses and became way more about assembling the teams that build the business one of the core functions we do at acquisition. probably the thing that we invest the most resources into is recruiting talent there's a reason that we go hard on linkedin because people respond to our messages and we're hey you ran all the ads at this $200 million per year director consumer business we have a director consumer business that's at 20 million would you be willing to take it from 20 to 200 because we think you have the experience or do anybody who does and because we have a falling there we get the responses and we can get that level talent but that level talent's not coming in for 100 grand a year you can moan all you want that oh these employees want much money but there's a marketplace there's a rate and if you're not willing to pay it there's a company that is smarter than you that is willing to pay it because they know the return on it and i still think to this day one of the biggest arbitrage that exists in business is paying a talent a wages to get 10x the output let me let me drive this home you can get a b player let's say let's use $100,000 as the baseline i want to hire a role for $100,000 for this thing and a b player in the role will take 80 and a b+ might take 90 or 100 but there might be an a+ plus guy who's 170 it's whoa that's twice our budget for this role but if that guy or gal has the output an a player can get you 5x 10x the output of a b player meaning five people who are b players at $100,000 a year equal one a++ at 170 that's still a great return and better than hiring 5bs and especially in knowledge work if you have anything that has to do with thinking and not where more hands are are required to do the work the outsize return on intelligence is high that i still see it as one of the fundamental arbitrage that exists in business how much time you save by hiring somebody who knows exactly what to do how it drives revenue in the business and they can use 10 years of experience that you don't have to pay i would rather pay 25% 30% more for somebody 50% more for somebody who can move me 10 years forward it seems almost silly when you frame it that not to but every day small business owners want to save $5,000 on an annual on on an annual salary for somebody who they know is perfect for the job this is truth number five if you want to get bigger get better better leads to growth bigger leads to bloat i was reading estr cathy's book wealth is it worth it and he talks about the story of chick-fil-a and he said that what his his number one pursuit was better not bigger and that he believed that if they were better and they kept getting better he said our customers will demand that we get bigger versus trying to get bigger for the sake of getting bigger and he tells a story between him chick-fil-a and boston market for those you who don't know boston market was a big chain when i was growing up that grew quickly and chickfila was privately held they take they took on almost no debt they grew responsibly one location at a time and boston market was we're going to franchise and we're going to raise a ton of money from wall street and we're going to make all this stuff and for a period of years they outg grew chick-fil-a by a mile and they were oh chick-fil-a is going to get left in the dust they're going to get al caped they're going to get crushed but because boston maret grew quickly because they didn't they diluted their talent because they had to hire many bodies and not enough brains and because they wanted to grow because they wanted valuations they wanted money they were what i would consider mercenaries whereas chick-fil-a and est cathy was a missionary he believed in the product he believed in the experience and because he's a faith-driven entrepreneur he wanted his restaurant to represent the tenants of christ this isn't me getting religious on it but he believed in his mission that's the point and basos talks about this he said you've got mercenaries you got missionaries the missionaries always win in the long term and what end up happening is that the money guys some of these guys cashed out early because stock got inflated all this stuff they took on tons of debt and then the the company ended bankrupting i don't know something 10 years later but guess what happened in that period of time chick-fil-a kept growing and is that boston market couldn't out compete chick-fil-a in their market they grew faster but is that if you've got a boston market in chickfila if that your chicken sandwich is you still always win it becomes an inevitability it doesn't matter if they get there first if you win in the end who cares because quality will always win provided it's priced appropriately that but better leads to bigger bigger leads to bloat and this has been something that was hard for hard for me to learn as an entrepreneur because we we them i the feedback of how much money are we making this month i want to make sure it goes up i want to make sure it goes up because that it's a it's a proxy for growth and and i used to say this and i i it which is either the business is growing or i am if the business isn't growing or the business is going down i'm growing i'm learning when i'm i'm messing up and if the business is growing sometimes you're not learning because the you're getting rewarded for the work that you did while you were learning while you're eating sometimes you get both and that's the ideal scene is that it's growing and you continue to learn and you st you keep your learnings ahead of the growth the trains coming and you're building out the track you're getting around the ditches you're going through the mountain you're digging the hole you're doing that stuff to the train can keep running and keep growing a big lesson that i have taken from est cathy and some of the best entrepreneurs elon if you're going to enter a market elon talks about this if you're going to enter a new marketplace you want to be an order of magnitude better than the existing solutions and i'll give you an example elon recently did he talked about getting into candy or chocolate which you might think why would he even bother getting into that it's because he had a gripe with warren buffett and charlie muger which is sad cuz i both of them he had a little bit of a rift with them oh he was fine i'll take out c candies and he was i'm going to get into chocolate and he had all these people send him different recipes and all this stuff and he decided not to do it and the reason he decided not to do it is he said that there was no product there was no version of chocolate or candies that was in order of magnitude better than what already existed he didn't want to play if you think about how he entered into the other markets he got into space and was oh we're going to redefine how space flight works we're going to use reusable things that we're going to drive down cost 10x compared to the competition that's an order of magnitude better with cars the first real tesla not the the roadster the high-end one but the first one he made for mass commercial use was the highest rated car that auto auto magazine the premium magazine had ever rated it got the highest overall score of all time because he focused much on making an order of magnitude better and is that tesla makes great cars by and large and customers have demanded they get bigger because they continue to out buy out purchase their supply and that forces supply to increase you grow and if you're stuck and you're i keep trying to grow and i can't grow sometimes you to think let's not grow what if we didn't want to grow at all but we had to make this thing absolutely insane from a quality perspective get better and the way that you do this tactically is that you look at each function of the business and you say what's one thing we can do better that we absolutely high confidence we're going to go from contacting our leads within 30 minutes to five minutes that's the one thing we're going to do for the next 12 weeks for for sales for marketing what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that every single ad has a hook that's been tested before that's what we're going to do we're going to make sure every ad that goes out is going to have hook that's tested and we're going to make five times more of them great that's what we're doing on marketing and every single one of them here's the key point is that once you start that new that one thing the next quarter you add to that you don't swap it and this is what most people do they do that one thing and then they forget what they were doing is that you end up creating this checklist of what creates amazing ads you create this checklist of what makes amazing followup you make this checklist of what makes an amazing handoff between sales and customer success make this checklist of how to activate a customer and it's 100 golden bbs not one silver bullet that creates the outsized returns and then once you have 100 golden bbs you start getting the word of mouth you start getting people who keep buying from you and then all of a sudden your ltv skyrockets and then you might find out if your ltv skyrockets maybe you don't have a marketing problem maybe you weren't making enough per customer and i can tell you this the amount of times i talk smart businesses who are we need cheaper leads we need cheaper leads we need we need to lower our cac the reality is they don't make enough for customer because they're not that good and either you mispriced which does happen for sure or your thing's not that good which is 100% under your control fundamentally growth is a lagging indicator the things you do to create growth are the leading indicators and the things that create growth are the things that make you better and having growth as a desired behavior is trying to make an outcome into an input and then what happens is you have quote growth for growth sake and here's the problem with this as a big big picture is that if the reason that you're in business is to quote make money if that's your real mission many things make money and what happens is you become distracted as an entrepreneur this is why the mercenaries fail compared to the missionaries because if you want to make the best chicken sandwich anything that's not a chicken sandwich isn't a priority they could have chick-fil-a credit cards or chick-fil-a miles they could do that stuff and they probably would make the money it's not core now go find out if they probably have a credit card who knows but the point is is that it's not core to what they know if money is the goal then there are many paths to getting there that it's difficult to stay focused which is why companies get spread thin which is why they grow for growth's sake and then all of a sudden they have five initiatives that are going on that all aren't working that because they couldn't focus on the thing that matter most which is getting better at the core promise that they make to customers business truth number six you work all day but you can't get anything done because you allow too many things that don't matter to distract you sometimes you have to let fires burn and what that means is that you have to block time for work that moves the ball forward because a month later it'll be the only thing you have to show for the month before and one of the things that took me a long time to realize is that there are few things that are existential crisis within hours even within minutes and the idea that everyone in the company and all of your customers etc can have immediate demand from you as or responses from you as the owner is not a good expectation because then it means that you're on demand for everyone else's needs but the business needs you and i'll give you a story to drive this home at my first gym i had started sleeping not at my gym which was wonderful for me and as i get my first few nights of sleep i get a call that everybody hates at 5:30 in the morning because that's when sessions happen and i was hello what's going on and he said i've got bad news and i immediately go to someone died from a heart attack in our gym that was the the immediately went there and i'm silent and i was what is it and then he says there's a a water pipe that broke and it's leaking on the floor and i was what do you want me to do it's i don't know what to do i i called you and i said what do you think i'm going to do he's i call a plumber and i was what what would i do in the meantime he's probably get a bucket i was yeah i was have you done that he was no i called you i was why don't you do those first two things because there's nothing i can do there's a story of elanor roosevelt when someone in her family died in the middle of the night she gets woken up by her servant or however they did it back then and he says mrs roosevelt i have some terrible news and it's 3:00 in the morning and she's what is it he's your cousin john died and she said that could have waited till morning there's nothing i can do about about it and there's few things that will kill a business and if you allow everything to be urgent it means that everything's a priority which means nothing is and priorities mean prior they come first and i prioritize my day by the things that matter most and i start my day i do prior to my day the thing that will move the ball forward because when i look back at my last month to see the progress that i've made i never think about susan who i had to give a refund to because she was dissatisfied for something or we got a onear review and we need to deal with that or our our chat support went down for two hours in the middle of the day and people were why did the chat support none of these things are existential crusies for the business in the short term there's almost nothing that kills a business in the short term and the only real thing is that your payment processing goes down you your ability to accept money goes away but beyond that there's not a lot of stuff and what you have to get comfortable with is letting some fires burn and being able to say yes this sucks but not getting the important work done will suck more and i spend and i still do this the first four to six hours of my day working on the things that matter most and that if i had a single habit that has gotten me the furthest in my life it's that i i work uninterrupted for the first four to six hours of my day on the things that think have the highest leverage in the business and i to think about that as what's the one thing that if it were true all of my other problems would go away and then i put all of my effort into making that one thing true or making that one thing happen but that can't happen if you have 20 other mini priorities that are urgent and not important every entrepreneur suffers from this and you have to draw lines in the sand or you will be spread too thin you will work all day and you will get nothing done to protect that first four to6 hours in the beginning i had to wake up early that mean i woke up at 4:00 i worked for 6 hours till 10:00 and i start my day at 10:00 as i made a little bit more money i was able to sleep in until 5: or and then start working at 6:00 and then i'd work from 6:00 to noon and everybody on my team this has been for years everyone my team knew do nothing until the afternoon alex only takes meetings in the afternoon and for me i do my thinking work in the morning and then i do my meetings in the afternoon as i hired more people more directors more leaders more executives a lot of those meetings all were able to disappear and now it became ivy meetings day and the remainder of my week is completely open here let me show you how this plays out in the real world someone reaches out and says hey i got to connect you with jimmy you guys would have a lot of synergies that this would be a important connection and i say i take meetings on mondays and they're oh i don't think he can do that and i say we won't meet we sit there and that's it and you'll be amazed often times that if they want to meet you they'll make it work on mondays and if it means that it's also three mondays from now then it's three mondays from now and i will say this if i don't meet jimmy you many people are there on earth there's 8 billion people i'm not going to meet most people and the likelihood that jimmy's going to do something that because if i know what i need to do to grow my business there's not a lot that jimmy's going to offer me there if i'm clear on my strategy and i'm clear on my execution anything that's not that fundamentally loses me money it certainly doesn't make me money and being with saying no and i'll give you the tactic around this which is saying i to say this is how i do this in social settings i' would say hey i'm not taking meetings until after my book launches and then once my book launches i'll say i'm not taking meetings until we sell this company and i'll always have something that i'll push out that's way far in advance that seems important that gives people a social reason to feel that i'm saying no to them not saying you're not important it's saying i've got this other thing that's important to me and that tends to work with entrepreneurs but you have to be with it if you have a team where you people manage your schedule for you i had to explain this to my we have three executive assistants that manage le and i calendars and i was if i if you put a meeting in the morning at 10:00 a.m. i was you've killed my whole morning it's shot i can't get into any deep work and then i'm going to have two hours and i'm going to have lunch again and i'm have other stuff out no we don't do that if they are going to do something and it's quote urgent and they have a strong argument that i put at the end of my day and i and i book from the back forwards and that means that if i say i want to end my day at 5 or then it means they're going to put my my first meeting of the day at 4 o'clock from 4 to 5: if it's an hourong meeting and if i have a second meeting that day then it's going to be from 3:00 to 4:00 and i still get my whole day until 3:00 uninterrupted i can work on the things that matter most and we have learned le and i working together that the more she takes off my calendar the more money we make and that's because that's where i'm most effective now the flip side is lea is such an exceptional operator and leader that her form of productivity is an absolutely stacked day that she can delegate invest in the team prioritize resources deal with small small decisions that have to move the ball forward check in on projects hope people accountable reward them for this the behaviors they've done interview new candidates that we need to bring into the company that's a super timec consuming thing that's high leverage and high value think about it if you have to take 20 interviews to find the person who can then take an hire 20 hours a week off your plate gez you spend 20 hours once to get 20 hours a week for life what a great return and this is why entrepreneurship at the highest levels i'm going to go on a side drain here but it'll be important entrepreneurship at the highest levels is always hiring ahead of where you're at and for people who don't their current business i can promise you that if you grow it enough you're going to be dealing with people all businesses at the top are you got a marketing person you got a salesperson you got a product person you got finance you got legal you got tech and that's that's the business and whether you're selling widgets you're selling services you're selling software fundamentally you're going to have a bunch of people that are executing those things and at the highest levels business is all the same and you have to learn how to play business at that level to keep playing at that level business truth number seven brand takes a long time to build but it's the most valuable thing that you can know it gives you the ability to get insane returns on advertising pric far above the market and keep people only buying from you it's hard to imagine something that is better than that it takes time and this was this is probably the lesson that took me long to learn year many many many many years i would say it took me a decade to learn this and it's i've only been able to reap the fruit of this in the last couple years and first off i didn't even understand what branding was branding is simply an association people make between something they know and something they don't know the thing they don't know is your business and the thing they do know should be something they and then over time that rubbing of the thing that they rubs off on your brand and eventually you can drop this thing and only have your company and they will make that positive association with you and there's three ways that people will make associations this is how you build the brand one is what you say or show that's controllable people will associate this hat with me and if you got value during this thing then you'll associate the value with acquisition. comom cool that's what i can say show this is adver ising me me making this content is advertising i'm letting people know about my stuff the second level is what other people tell them and that means either someone who's interacted with your advertising or someone who's interacted with your product it's hey i saw this this trailer for mission impossible 306 and and you're i'm going to go see it now if your friend says oh i saw it it was it was bad don't waste your money the likely i go see it if i if i agree with that person's taste that's key side note there if i tend to the same movies they then i would take that heavily if it's my mom and i don't agree with movies that she likes i might go see it more because i'm oh if she hatte it i'll probably love it and what you say as the company owner is thing one that you can control the most thing two that you can't control is what other people say about your stuff which then goes to c or three which is what the customer ends up saying once they experience it it's what you say what other people say and what they experience and as you can imagine what they experience is going to be the strongest thing the ad you think about going to the movie someone tells you something about the movie maybe that influen your decision once the movie then you you have a much stronger opinion and you can see another ad about the movie but you're i don't care what the ad says i saw the movie i bought the sandwich i went to use their marketing services you have a informed opinion because you had an experience and this is why brand and product are always going to be interrelated because how do you get what other people say to be good to your potential prospects you make sure that their experience was exceptional that when they do see it they say hey the movie was awesome you should go see it now if someone who i a lot says hey the movie was awesome you should go see it and i'm i saw the ads i didn't think it was that good and they're dude believe me see it now all of a sudden i had poor advertising they have a high likel of seeing and then if i go see you and i say wow he was this was awesome then i'm i tell other people now here's what gets interesting if i go see it and it sucks i that influences the brand of my friend who told me about it because now i don't believe their opinion of movies anymore and that's why as a side note when people refer people to your business they have to be treated because that person who made the referral risks relational capital they risk their personal brand to the friend and the reason they make that risk is they want to get a return on it hey you should see this movie because they want the friend to associate the good experience with the movie with them and that's why people do things that's why you do refer products that you because you want people to associate or have that problem solved because of the thing that you connected them to and we want to be that connection and that's how we make money now if we're thinking long term though from a branding perspective if you make a big promise and you deliver on that promise consistently people will say wow they are what they said they were which is one of my biggest rules of marketing is state the facts and tell the truth don't make promises you can't keep and say hey this is why i using historic which is this is what has happened i don't know if it'll happen for you but if if you're willing to take that bet then there you go and if we think about the things that are some of the strongest levers in business price is the strongest lever on profit of all things that you can control business if you get people to buy something for a million dollars that other people buy for $10 you're going to make a lot of money and price is one of the strongest things that has a lever on market and you can measure the strength of a brand by how much above the commoditized price or what other competitors charge you can charge because of your brand premium if you look at a nike versus a generic brand for t-shirts shorts shoes basketballs they will charge a premium and they will get that premium and they're able to sell more units at higher prices because of their brand because the associations people have with them and then the roi from the brand becomes how much does it cost me to make these associations that people find positive and then you spread that out or you fractionalize that against how much of it increase in price you can have against the commodity and if i sell a million units of something and i can sell it for $3 above market then i have $3 million of excess that that brand buys me and if i can get an association that yields me that outcome for let's say i can get a championship fighter for 250 grand a year to be in my ads then i get a 10 to one or i say 300,000 to make it math simple if i pay $300,000 for that association and i can now charge and make $3 million extra i get 10 to1 on that branding the row as you get return on advertising spend absolutely still all the metrics makes count the same for branding as they do with direct response advertising you have to measure over a longer time horizon that's the difference and and i will say on a personal level branding gets you far better returns on advertising than anything else it takes longer and think about the direct response world as your paycheck it's you're you write a check in and you get money out you write a check in and the moment you stop spending that money you stop making money brand is your long-term investment in the beginning you you're investing money into your ira you're investing money into your 401k you're investing money in the stock market but it's not compounding yet but is that you keep doing that you keep doing that you keep doing that and all of a sudden the compounding starts to become this monster that you couldn't even you couldn't you can't even spend enough markting dollars to make up for that level of compounding and that's what happens over time it takes time to get there but the way that you control it are that you make sure that the things that you were saying about yourself are associ with things that the people who you're trying to sell to associate positively and this happens in content and also the people that you associate with publicly the second part that you can control is how much you deliver on the promise because the experience is always going to be the heaviest weighted thing that people have now the approximation of an experience is a review the reason reviews matter much is because we see that cool they say they're great now i go to their site and i read reviews to see are they telling the truth or not based on approx reviews and then i say this guy had a one star but it looks he isn't a lot me now i look at these other guys oh these are a lot more my use case and they had five stars then my risk adjusted on making this purchase is low now i buy it and then i decide for myself but the branding is a loop it helps make the purchasing decision and if you fulfill on that then guess what they're not going to do they took a risk by buying your product not knowing who you were they don't want to take that risk again and if you deliver on the promise they will buy again from you even even with the premium and this is how you start how branding of itself can create a competitive mode people who buy apple become apple buyers they only buy apple and even though somebody else's product might even be better they don't want to risk trying it they don't want to have the cost of learning a new interface and all this other stuff and brand gets you higher returns on advertising allows you to price far above the market and get people that once they buy from you they keep buying from you and you do that by what you say what other people say and what customers experience at the end when they use your product and that either gets them into the buying loop again forever or it kicks them out if you look at the cuttingedge direct response world the strategies that they use approximate a brand and let me explain what that means if you go to quote cold traffic people who don't know who you are you have no association once those people go in your world often times unless it's a widget or something that's a impulse purchase you have something called a warm-up sequence or a nurture sequence or you deliver value or you give lead magnets these are all things that approximate branding if i give someone let's say a pdf that is valuable thought out has lots of research in it someone would get a lot of value from that and then i approximated a purchase with them they gave they did an exchange they got something and then that thing was valuable and they used that to extrapolate into what a decision would be or what a product would be if they made a purchase from you and you have these things 5-day challenges that people will run to try and have lots of people for 5 days because if you spend let's let's say 5 hours with someone that might be the same in terms of their warmth to you or the associations they have with you as someone who might have spent a year consuming a 60-second clip twice a week now i will say that extending that the time horizon over time does have elements of trust that i won't get into but they try to approximate what a trusting relationship would look which is exactly how you build brand but they try and condense the time window and this is why if they want to sell you swamp land they invite you to a vacation for free and they spend two days with you pitching swamp land because at the end of two days you're why i spent 24 hours with this person i can trust them and they build a reputation in a minor in a mini way in a tiny audience to make the sale whereas if you want to build in my opinion big big brand you want to build that same level of trust across millions of people and then when you say hey i've got something they all act as though they've been with you for two straight days to make the purchase and if you spent two days with someone said hey buy my basketball they'll all buy it but you do that times a million and that's what big brand looks bas is truth number eight you need to know what inputs and outputs your money-making system are broken down to the absolute smallest action and that way you can crank the hell out of it let me explain if i say all this happens all the time we we want to invest to a company we come in and a a lot of times in we're in the diligence part of the of the deal cycle and i say you've got five sales guys and you're spending 5,000 bucks a day on ads that's your primary way of getting leads why aren't we spending 50,000 a day i asked the question why what stops us from spending 50,000 a day and then a number of things will come up and then the question is how solvable are all those things now if they say whenever we spend more money our row as goes down it be i would see that as your ad suck great if they say we can't handle the call volume then i'd be oh you don't know how to hire recruit and train salese cool if they say oh we could it's that we couldn't deliver based on the promises that we make because we have a lot of high touch service you need to we need to systematize more stuff on the back end and get better training in place on the back end ideally maybe bring someone in who's ruling ruling that oding that rather than the founder who split between too many places you can you can quickly understand where the constraint of the business is by simply asking why can't we 10x this now the skill of an individual is inversely proportional to how vague your direction can be let me explain if i if someone comes to me and says hey alex i have this product can you promote it i have no marketing department can you promote it he can say that or she can say that and i will know everything else that that means at the absolute lowest level if you say that to a 5-year-old you'd be this is what promotion means and there's all these different ways we can promote and i need you to learn how to turn on a computer and then this is how you create an email and this is how you you'd have to go step by step by step and the more vague your direction the more skilled the individuals you need to have in order to do it which by the way is why smart people is a great investment because it's more efficient from a communication perspective i can say hey john fix churn and i can say fix churn and he knows all the subtasks underneath of it but over time it's valuable for you as the entrepreneur to know as much much of that dirt as you can you can level check and say how good is this person they doing their job etc now let's go to advertising a simple example let's use the example i had earlier we had three different problems that i presented i said why can't we 10x this thing the first version of the problem was their ads suck and i say you can't scale your row as there either it's not that they're it's that the the tam could be bad as in they could be a local market and you can't 10 extra ad been from 5,000 to 50,000 a day cuz there's not that many people in the local market but assuming that that's not the case it's that their ads suck that i say walk me through the process of how you make ads and then what we say is usually you can nail it down to you're not doing enough pre-work and pre-work is defined as i need you before you start to sit down and write ads that you're going to look at the top 20 ads you've done of all time you're going to rewatch them step one step two you're going to go through all the ads that you saw this week across all your platforms that you thought were interesting that you would to model step two step three you're going to recreate the best ads you've done you're going to remake make them step two you're going to take the best ads and reformat them old footage new edit versus same message new take and then we're also going to create 30 more ads that are completely new net new takes using the ideas that you had inspiration from and inspiring from old ads that you've used before that you're not redoing the same messaging you're mixing and matching and doing a remix and it's great this is the process and and you're going to do this every week and that means that you're going to spend half a day prepping and half a day filming every single week now it's easy for me to say when i say hey are you doing the ads process that i i outlined they're no i we are but it's it's not working i'm show me the hooks that you wrote from the ads that were already working show me the remixes that you did from the best performers show me your album that you've been saving for all the ads that you if they can't show me these things they're not doing the fundamental actions that's example one if i said that it was the they can't scale the sales team then i'd say how do we scale the sales team oh we got to go get people what does that mean from an action level it turns out it means that we need to reach out to 100 people on linkedin in order to get one person hired based on our turn rate for sales guys let's say we lose one person a quarter that happens more with bigger teams as a side note say if if we do three reach outs a day over 90 days then we're going to replace our turn we're going to have 90 reach outs it's going to create one good guy and we're going to lose one guy we're never going to grow the team they're oh it's if we need to 10x this team then we need to do 100 gets us one and we lose a third of a sales rep per month which if it's we had a 5% in we'd be losing 20% per month by the way you get employee turn the same we you get customer turn and you say our rate is 20% turn now is there things we can fix that sure but for the sake of this this example we say all we need to get if we want to double this team this quarter we need to do 500 reach outs now 500 reach outs is going to result in call it 50 interviews and 50 interviews is going to take them some try we need to take at least call it 10 maybe 15 interviews a week because we want to be ahead because i don't want to get it by the end i want to get i want to have these people done and onboard and productive by the end of this quarter not finished and if you're wow going from 5 to 10 is a lot dude we put we went from 0 to 40 in a company it's 100% your belief set of what's possible and i will tell you this now this a a life hack for making more money you will many entrepreneurs youve built a five person sales team and you immediately scale business you do next to a five person sales team and then you stop there because you don't know how to grow past that and you do what you're comfortable with you're a lot of you guys are comfortable at $1,000 day anp and you know how to do that and you can't get past that and you have to break these these these limiters that you have say why can't i spend 10,000 a day why can't i hire 30 sales guys to do outbound in 90 days i heard a story of a multi-billionaire entrepreneur ex blackstone guy has raised billions and millions of dollars and he became i can't share the company company's worth over 100 billion now and it's not shopify because if you're thinking about harley it's not him and he started this new fund and in order to start it and he raised 20 billion his first highle dude what he did was he flew out he did 200 interviews in seven days and he said everybody come here fly out to my warehouse he had his team of five killers with him that he knew from that he took from his last thing and he did 200 interviews in seven days and then he got his team to start the next thing that's the difference in terms of level of execution that higher higher level entrepreneurs do that it would take a junior entrepreneur 3 years to do that because they choose to believe they can only take two interviews a week if it is the constraint of the business it is your job and you have to be able to break down what the inputs of the business are at the most actual level that yield output figure out the problem and then figure out the action that you do not not the not the output the action that you have to do the inputs at the most basic level that you can crank the hell out of it basis truth number nine stop looking for hacks and hacks different than shortcuts when when something on oh the they're start doing these hashtags because that's what's working or start doing this this new messenger thing that's only going to work for 60 days is that if you have to jump from these little mini trends to mini trends to mini trends the moment that little mini arbitrage thing is done you're done you want to focus on what the overall objective of of the platforms that you advertise on are and if i know that for example youtube wants people to click and they want them to watch and ideally watch something else then if i always optimize all my effort to getting those big things whether something's trending or oh yellow yellow yellow backgrounds are doing in the short term we're you want to make sure that you respond to every single comment within six minutes otherwise it it changes the anytime someone tells me algorithm stuff i ignore it because unless the goal of a platform has fundamentally changed all of this other stuff is is distraction because again what's the one thing that matters most if i make something that's good that everyone is going to share and the moment they watch they can't wait to tell other people about it the platform is g to is going to want to distribute that i don't care what the algorithm is it's going to want to distribute that and even if it doesn't this is a real talk even if it doesn't the 100 people who saw it will get what i want out of it and is that it's much better to spend a 100 hours making one exceptional thing than doing 100 things mediocrely and now some of that's wait a second how does that contradict with you got to do lots of quantity quantity matters because it teaches you how much work it takes to create quality and once you learn and this is if you look at i youtubers because it's they have documented work cycles and you can see all their product and marketing in the same place is that in the beginning many of them make more videos and then over time they realize that if they make a better video it has outsize returns meaning if you make a video that's 20% better than your average video you might get five times the views and it might take only twice as much work to make your video 20% better and then all of a sudden you're oh instead of making two videos i'll make one that's 20% better and then i'll get five times the views and then that becomes the new standard then all of a sudden it's now we're making videos of this standard but if i spend twice time as i did on that video i get this video that was already 20% better another 20% better and then that gets five times the views of the five times the views and what happens is over time you learn how much work it takes to make something great and that is why quality starts to over time all these platforms will always optimize towards quality because there is no lack of information people have google they can find out they want what they want is value per second not seconds of value and our job if we want to make anything whether it's a product whether it's marketing whether it's an ad whether it's a service that we give that we sell is that it's i i get tired of hearing the entrepreneur story and i used to be one of these guys which is i get frustrated this is me yelling at my younger self is is i i provide much value there's much stuff that i give them but the internet gives them everything for nothing and it's not that people want more they want better they want us to do the work ahead of time people want to bargain they want how can i compress 13 years of business lessons into two hours how do i how do i do that how do i how do i get the lessons from 35,000 post in 60 minutes they want that they don't want you to say hey what dude i put all 35,000 of my posts inside of this membership login it's much value they're not going to get value from it because what would be much more valuable is distilling all of that down to the most concrete form where every time they consume it the value they get per second is high they can't stop that's where and when you're thinking about this stuff quality is in the details that you only realize with lots of exposure and about this coats of paint when i write a book it's it's not i sit down and or write it i write the first draft and then i put another code of paint on it and then i put a third code of paint on it and the fourth code of paint on it and and and i'll say this was a gift i got from the consulting in and and and banking world which is how they edit how it works first you make a deck or a brief or deliverable you're going to have to a customer or client that's round one the second round you look for punctuation errors the third round you look for data errors the fourth round you look for misspellings and typos the fifth round now all of a sudden every time you're reading it you're also going to catch other stuff too but you're specifically looking for one type of thing and i'm not a video editor but i would bet that this is exactly how you edit video you think let's look for lighting this time let's look at transitions this time let's look at sound and music this time let's look at the actual content itself this time and make sure that there there there's no there's no gaps or space and it's coats of paint and that exposure over time and looking at it when you when you start early in the morning and the second time you look at it it's after lunch the third time you look at it in your bad mood and the fourth time you look at it you talk to your wife about this other thing and that's top of mind and you you look at it these different frames and you get away it's sanding down the rough edges and you keep getting at it and you put different level grade sandpaper it gets finer and smoother and smoother but that only happens with exposure over time and lots of licks and you make the money you make the money in the edit you make the money in the distillation not in the creation and stop focusing on the hacks and put all your effort into the repeated bouts and bursts and going over with the sandpaper and the second coat and the third coat and the fourth coat of paint that is how you can escape mediocrity and that's what everyone is mediocre is unwilling to do they think that the moment they put the last period on their document that they finish writing a book when they put 80,000 words into a document that no one's ever going to read and you can teach quality to people by teaching the process that begets quality if you say the first thing we do is we have a wireframe and every wireframe has to have a hook a story lists or steps for an outcome and then a conclusion that meets these standards that's the wireframe have we done that checkbox one checkbox two we record the whole thing we fill in the gaps great checkbox three we look for transitions checkbox four we look for and then they can follow your step for creating quality and most people never document what they do which is why every time they have to reinvent the wheel and they have to reinvent the wheel for every new person who comes into their company which is why it's taxing when you're small to bring people on because you feel you have no training you have no systems but if you can document these things for yourself which a by the way will make you better b it also make it easier for you to bring your people in you can ultimately replace yourself and keep the quality where you want it to be bsiness truth 10 the best people cost more but make you way more than they cost it's still one of the biggest arbitrage opportunities that exist in business and will continue to exist in business as long as humans work and and that small business owners never get this it's the big businesses that are competing for talent that's where the talent where happens is at the top and do you think there's a coincidence that the biggest businesses are the ones that are competing for talent why do you think that is it's because they understand that talent is what makes them a big business and is and this is where small businesses get in trouble again and i did this too is that you have to be worthy of the level of talent that you need and have a mission that's aligned with what they find meaningful i have a i have an that's in the porn business i have no moral comms he does legal everything he does is legal do what you want one of the issues that he has is it's hard for him to find high level talent because a lot of people don't want to work in the porn industry and i say that as as a hypothetical extreme but some of you guys are working one degree less than that you're i sell a day trading thing it's oh you are somehow you beat the market obviously if you sell day trading then you should be day trading and not selling courses on how to day trade if you were good at it and you definitely wouldn't tell people what the trades were duh and the thing here is the level of talent that you can attract for that level of opportunities can be different from i want to create something that takes all trash and turns it into energy you're going to get people who are mission driven there's a reason that every single one of elon musk's businesses is here to save the world that's not a mistake now there's two elements to that one is that they could save the world the second is that that's what he makes it about twitter before this wasn't about having free speech and civilization it was a social media platform but now it's the last beacon or bastion of free speech that's what elon has positioned it as now ula which is united launch alliance which is a government contracted that does a lot of space things you might not have heard of them but spacex is how mankind is going to survive if anything happens to earth and we're going to become an interplanetary species the likelihood that we can survive any event if we're a multiplanetary species goes up for our survival as a race and he made spacex not about doing rockets and government contracting which although that is how they make their money he made it about saving humanity tesla is about its electronic cars there is a zillion other car companies that have electronic cars but why is it only tesla is about having this because it's the future of having earth be environmentally friendly every one of his companies he makes about saving the world and by doing that you get people who will work not and day to save the world and i'll give you four little personal examples that i've had or sorry three personal examples that i've had around this i remember when i had my first $50,000 year employee because before this i'd only worked with hourly hourly wage employees at my gyms and that one person gave me the time because they could manage my first location to open up my second location which made 250,000 a year in profit and wait i paid $50,000 a year for somebody out of one location to allow me to open up my second location made $250 50,000 i got 5 to one on that great investment now somebody might say oh why would you give up $50,000 when you could do that cuz i want to make 250 on the next thing the second story i had this is a little a little bigger my first $300,000 year employee guess what they did this was my first exceptional salesperson he brought in $5 million in sales that year i paid him 300 grand was that worth it absolutely was it more than i'd ever paid a sales pres for absolutely it was worth it and it was even worth it my first million dooll employee immediately in their first 90 days saved me 3 million bucks a year immediately and she was all i want to make sure i paid for myself now let's do this other stuff and then with her contacts in her rolodex allowed us to package our companies and then sell them through her network of bankers and private equity firms and i didn't come from that world and i hired an executive that had 35 years of experience who had sold who had been sside over 40 times because i was i've never done this before and i found somebody who already had now i had to pay him a million dollars a year but was it worth it more than anything and is that what's crazy is that the stories i told you the arbitrage on value increased as i spent more think about crazy that is a $50,000 got me a 5x a 300 got me a 14x a million got me a 50x this is why that talent is still the most underrated big biggest money-making arbitrage opportunity that exists and the biggest constraint to you getting there is that your company's and you're brutal business tr number 11 the big obvious thing is the problem not the hundred other things i want to be clear about this the details absolutely matter but when i talk to business owners today the vast majority of the time i can keep hitting them on this one question because they want to avoid answering it and i'm have you tried your food have you gone through the workouts you sell have you been a customer of your own product and more times than not the answer is no not recently and they're no but i don't think that's the problem because a lot of times the hard thing is the thing that hurts your ego the most and this's a quote from williamson chris williamson he said the magic you're looking for is the work in the work you're avoiding and that's absolutely true also from a business perspective is that what thing if it were true would hurt your feelings the most often times that thing is the truth and it's the one that we're not willing to face let's be real your service might not be that good let's be real the reason your restaurant isn't growing isn't because your seo isn't updated it's not because your website isn't optimized it's because your food sucks and the real real is that it might not even suck it might be mediocre but the difference between mediocre and exceptional is those hundred details but most people are working on all these other things beyond the main thing that matters most and i remember pelaton the story of the founders they were talking about how they were trying to build pelaton they said what we did is we fundamentally believe that if we could be the best part of everyone's day that if everybody who came to one of our workouts left saying that was unbelievable and they had to tell people about it they're how good would we have to make it that the next person they talked to it was the first thing they brought up and i love that as a litmus test for how good is the thing that i sell and many people do anything they can to have quote something to sell some to sell but that's the reason you get stuck because is that on some level whether you admit it or not it could be better and that then influences how hard you push because if you believed you had the best pizza in the world and i hear this all the time people oh we're the absolute best i'm no you're not dude no you're not stop saying that because when if you say that you're lying on some level and you're lying to other people and you're lying to yourself and most business owners lie to themselves about how good they are at the things that they do because confronting the fact that they're insufficient they're not good enough they're inexperienced they haven't put enough work in to be good frightens them and then they want to scatter their focus to hundred things that they read online but unless the workouts are amazing unless the food is exceptional long term all you do is you let lots of people know that your food's mediocre and that's where thinking about business in terms of years and decades starts paying off because if you believe that you're going to go big and you want to go big then you want as few people as possible to find out about the product when it's mediocre rather than as many people as possible and it's counterintuitive because you have to pay bills today and tomorrow and you need to advertise enough that you can continue to iterate the product and then when you nail it when people are stoked when you're starting to grow on your own based on the word of mouth because as soon as people leave your establishment they leave your business they get off a call with you it is they then can't help but tell everybody they talk to that day about your thing that is when you add the gasoline that's when you pour it on for example my my most recent investment school.com which is a community platform for helping people build and monetized communities i had been watching that company since 2018 and watching what sam the founder was doing and watching how he was iterating the product and when i decided to become a co-owner of the business it was because the business was growing on its own it had zero marketing and it was growing month after month and had net growth every single day based on people telling other people about the product and that's when i knew i was if this thing can grow without me then how much more will it grow with me and that's what i want to get into i want to get into a business where i already know the product's exceptional i already know it has a a a base rate of growth based on word of mouth that now when i introduce thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people to the platform they will associate me with that value and i know that the product will deliver and then take over from the they're not going to buy they might buy because of the association but they stay because of the product i've created all of my wealth in four distinct periods in the beginning with my gym i had a 30 to1 return on advertising the reason that that arbitrage existed meaning i put a dollar and i get $30 out i put $1,000 in i get $30,000 out the reason that arbitrage existed was because facebook at the time was wildly underpriced i'm going to be honest that's why that first arbitrage happened the next arbitrage that occurred was in gym launch where we got 100 to one for the first year i spent a 100 grand and made $10 million yes and as a side note most of the wealthy people that i know had distinct periods of time where opportunity presented itself and then they back the truck up they went all in on that thing what happens in between is you make normal money but it's those those windows of time where these opportunities present themselves where we can make crazy money gym launch was a 100 to1 and the reason it was 100 to1 was because the product that i was selling was the 30 to1 thing that i had from the gyms and everybody who became a len then was immediately printing money in their gym and the product was good what ended up happening i i say and now i'm going to give you a look behind the curtain here i say at 100 to1 which i did but the reality is i spent $100,000 and made 10 million and a lot of that was from word of mouth because if iid spent $0 i don't know how much money i would have made versus spending the 100 grand that i did on ads but i still probably would have made a decent amount of money on zero ads bend because the people came in got the result we promised and then told five other gyms and especially in a niche the people everyone knows everyone the smaller the niche the smaller the local market the more connected it is and the more word of mouth matters and that's where you can get these absurd returns that's when you get into this it feels printing money because if you have good margins on the thing and you have zero cost to acquire or low cost to acquire because of the word of mouth then it goes nuts and you you're accepting money hand over fist oh my god this is unbelievable and if anything that's when you throttle back to make sure that you can consistently keep that word of mouth and you can deliver on your promises by the way if this is valuable for you or your team or your executive team don't be lame share the game this is how we know that you want us to make more of this we look at data the more people share it the more we make more of that stuff and if you're a business owner specifically i'm calling you out i'm making my stuff for you and please share it i know that this is the type of stuff you want
