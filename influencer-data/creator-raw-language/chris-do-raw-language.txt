let's talk about personal branding. not the surface level stuff - the deep strategy that transforms your business. a brand is not a logo. it's not your color palette. it's not your font choices. a brand is a person's gut feeling about you, your product, or your service. it's emotional, not rational. i've been doing this for 28 years. built and sold agencies, taught thousands of creatives, and here's what i've learned - most people have it backwards. they think tactics before strategy. the first question isn't "what should i post?" it's "who am i for?" if you try to be for everyone, you're for no one. specificity is the key to resonance. when i started, i tried to serve everyone who needed design. failed miserably. then i focused only on entertainment companies wanting bold, innovative motion design. revenue went 10x. here's the framework - purpose, position, personality, and promise. your purpose is your why. position is where you fit in the market. personality is how you show up. promise is what people can expect. most creatives undercharge because they don't understand value. you're not selling time, you're selling transformation. a logo isn't worth $500 or $50,000 - it's worth what it does for the business. i once charged $100,000 for a two-day strategy session. the client made $10 million from what we developed. was i expensive? or was i the best investment they ever made? the way you present determines your value. if you show up desperate, you'll be treated as a commodity. show up as an expert, and you'll be treated as an investment. let's talk about the business of creativity. most creatives are artists pretending to be business people. you need to be a business person who happens to create. big difference. your portfolio doesn't sell you. your ability to articulate value sells you. i've seen mediocre work win million-dollar contracts because the creative understood business strategy. here's how to fix your personal brand. first, audit everything. every touchpoint needs to align with your positioning. your website, social media, email signature - everything. second, develop your point of view. what do you believe that others don't? what hill are you willing to die on? that's where your brand lives. third, be consistent. not visually, but philosophically. every piece of content should reinforce your core message. repetition creates reputation. the pricing conversation is where most creatives fail. they present a number and hope. i teach value-based pricing. understand the client's business metrics, then price accordingly. for 2025, here's what matters. ai won't replace creatives who think strategically. it will replace those who only execute. become irreplaceable by solving business problems, not design problems. stop competing on better. compete on different. better is subjective and exhausting. different is observable and defendable. the future belongs to creatives who understand that design is a business tool, not an art form. those who can connect creativity to commerce will thrive. everyone else will struggle. build your brand you'd design for a client. with strategy, intention, and clarity. that's how you transform from a freelancer to a business owner.
