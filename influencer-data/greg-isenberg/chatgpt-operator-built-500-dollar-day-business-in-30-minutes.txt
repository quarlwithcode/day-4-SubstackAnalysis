TRANSCRIPT
========================================

so check this tweet out Chris Corner goes my mind is officially blown I got the $200 month Pro chat GPT plan and had the operator which is an AI agent start a business for me while I watched it messaged folks on Facebook Marketplace loged their replies in a spreadsheet and they responded I recorded my screen the entire time mustat so I invited Chris to do the exact same name he gives three examples of how to use operator to start a business do research for you do cold email for you you don't need to spend the $200 a month uh just watch this and you're going to see the future [Music] starty so we're going to use operator today and what do we what are we going to do with operator okay so I've got a couple a couple plans and I don't know if we'll get to all of them but I'm a pizza afficionado I have an outdoor pizza oven I cook double zero flour pizza with filtered water in my backyard at 900 Degrees and so I love it and so I was thinking okay let's say I want to start a little side hustle maybe some Retail Arbitrage buy something on Facebook Marketplace sell it on eBay I need to find some price discrepancies so I'm going to share share my screen and show you what my prompt was all right so my prompt was I want to find a gney pizza oven in any Market on Facebook Marketplace that is grossly undervalued when compared to the same model of pizza ovens listed um for sale in any Market they need to be willing to ship to me go so it was already logged into my Facebook account um I told it to start within 500 miles of Dallas so it did it changed it to my area to Dallas um and then I gave it a spreadsheet and I said hey here's a spreadsheet and it was blank and here it is I said go ahead and put some titles in there and I want you to take note of the ones that look promising as you go um so it worked for two minutes and it said I found a promising gsy Rockbox list on Facebook Marketplace for 250 which is undervalued compared to others which that's awesome and I chose this product because I have a gny I know what they're priced at and I wanted to know how accurate it was says it includes a peel and a propane burner and is in good condition I've logged the details in provided spreadsheet would you like me to look for more yes so just looking at this that is a great price like this is a $500 Pizza Oven in its current condition with the included accessories so we're off to a strong start any thoughts questions like how I okay how how big of a business could you create around this good question um I think you could build a six or a seven figure business around what I'm doing here not necessarily for pizza ovens but for anything undervalued um it's just Arbitrage so you know if you're GNA if if I'm going to clean out my garage and there's an old Pizza Oven in there and I want to sell it even though I know about all these marketplaces because I've been just a side Hustler my whole life I'm just going to listen on Facebook Marketplace because it's the most frictionless and it's local and I don't want to ship it and it's easy um but if I had more time I would probably list it on eBay because it's a much bigger audience um and so there is an opportunity for anyone to find any preferably High tick product that is listed on One Market at an undervalued price and then sell it on another Market at a fair market Price um this is something that I'm not inventing people do it every day but they're either doing it themselves or using um uh virtual assistants to do it whereas now this can all be done in the background for me and by the way Arbitrage as like a business technique like it runs businesses like there's so much you know there's so much uh you I'll give you an example like um I one of my first side hustles or hustles as a kid was I noticed that when DVD box sets first came out I used to buy DVD box sets in Canada that were like lost leaders and then sell it in the United States for American dollars buying Canadian dollars selling American dollars make a profit on eBay which was a new platform right like super simple Arbitrage what you're say you know very simple idea that you know you can make a decent amount of money what you're you're showing me here with operators is really interesting because this is doesn't require human beings like it required me to like go into the store uh it required me to understand okay there's margin over here go look at eBay what is the Canadian to US Dollar exchange rate what's so fascinating about this is how automated it is yeah I'm I my arms are crossed right now I'm just watching this happen now it's you know you could say well why it's the same thing as doing it yourself but you know most people have multiple uh monitors I could just put it over there and just do my work and it could just go and I could just kind of check in on it which is even better than a virtual assistant because I can't really check up on them um but if you look it's already added two options and it tells me why they're promising now it's it's putting the same thing due to condition and price but it's putting the title the location the condition and then the link and now I'm going to take it a step further and say um go ahead and offer for half price for all of these in state that I can pay cash so now I'm telling it to message the listing the the seller uh and I I just kind of want to see what it says like I I purposely didn't give it very much instruction because I just want to see um and it's two different prices so I told it uh unable to make offers on your behalf um I did this yesterday I I that's what was in my video it's like how do you say you did it yesterday without being rude you know I know right and it I talked to a guy that's trying to do something similar to this and Facebook doesn't work in his operator at all um so it it seems like the results are pretty hit and miss right now but it is going to message them right now so maybe I just have to kind of like crawl walk run and like get them to message them first and then tell them to say something else well I think this is what's this is interesting I'm actually happy that this happened because um this is part of the Arbitrage this is part of the Arbitrage because some people are going to sign up to operator and be like oh it doesn't message people on Facebook but it's actually you just have to prompt it in the right right way yeah yeah exactly and just like Chad gbt quick break in the Pod to tell you a little bit about startup Empire so startup Empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people like me like you who want to build out their startup ideas now they're looking for content to help accelerate that they're looking for potential co-founders they're looking for uh tutorials from people like me to come in and tell them how do you do email marketing how do you build an audience how do you go viral on Twitter all these different things that's exactly what up Empire is and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but just they're not seeing the traction uh that they need so you can check out the link to Startup empire.co in the description it's funny cuz a lot of the comments on my tweet were like it's so stupid it doesn't even work well it's so buggy waste of money and have you ever seen that Louis CK bit about the internet yeah where he's like people complain about the internet like or like they're on an airplane and he's like the internet's slow it's so laggy he's like dude it has to go to space it has to go so it's like chill out we have artificial intelligence working for us like calm down now could you have multiple operators running at the same time if you had multiple $200 a month subscriptions yeah as long as you're in the US and you create a new account I don't see why not so and even if you're not in the US if you use a VPN yeah that's true so it is asking me like are you sure I can message them but then it [Laughter] does marketers ruining the internet operators ruining the internet I know markeet marketers are having their Heyday right now so it says closing chat for Clear listings it's just it's literally acting like a human like it can't see all the listings so it closed the chat window okay so what is your your vision here so you're going to let's you know to create a business around this like you'd actually like how do you actually take this from okay I'm I'm buying cheap undervalued pizza ovens to like I I this is an automated business that's generating income so what I would do is I would have the operator go do research on eBay uh pricing research and and give me an average price for the same make model oven and then let's say it's $300 I would have it go make offers on my behalf for $150 for every gsy that's been listed for 30 days or more the longer it's been listed the more likely they are to take a lowball offer as soon as they they say yes for 150 um I would go L I would take the pictures list the same thing on eBay um for 250 um at a buy now price once it sells I would collect payment I would send the payment to Facebook to Facebook Marketplace and I would provide the ultimate end buyer uh address to the Facebook Marketplace seller and they would just ship it directly to them and that's like pretty automated right that could totally be done so it it's not a it's not saying a price it's like stopping there I could probably finesse it some more but I think you get the idea yeah absolutely so and we go over here to the spreadsheet it put in two of them and it put links to them so pretty cool should uh should I reach out to some Caterers for my fake wedding I don't see why not Chris okay all right let's do this so I'm gonna save this task I can revisit it later oh I'm on the wrong tab here we go all right so these are my save tasks [Music] so I'm going to go create a new one and I'm going to say I'm hosting a wedding and need need catering quotes for 50 people stake plus two sides in Dallas Texas reach out to Caterers onth knot.com and tell them all this to get a per head quote okay so imagine I'm about to get married uh I need catering quotes venue quotes flower quotes and the more quotes I get the more money I save right it's directly in my best interest to get as many quotes as possible but who wants to get on the phone and call hundreds of people so I've never done this before this is brand new it could glitch on me I created a the not.com account just for this experiment and let's just see what it does so I didn't like you saw what this is the whole prompt I don't know if it knows the knot if it can find its way there it's searching caterers in my general area switch to Dallas I assumed you needed to have an account to reach out but we'll see this is crazy dude it's crazy it's crazy like I could go to sleep and wake up with a dozen quotes in my inbox and that would be an afternoon I mean you're talking I I hate calling place the worst the worst did I tell you about the domain name I bought uh to build this as like a voice calling uh service I'm not ever going to do it but I'm just a domain name degenerate it's called neverall again.com where you you just like click a button and using like air or you know any of those voice agents it just calls like okay five minutes later I called 100 Caterers here's all your quotes and the prompt is like hey uh I'm calling on behalf of mallerie she's hosting a wedding I am an AI agent if you hear any awkward pauses but you can talk to me like a human I'm going to relay everything back to mallerie she's budgeting for $13 ahead she wants a stake in two sides what it's the best you can do so it just like gets ahead of it I'm AI but I'm sending this to the real person that's going to be paying you money what can you do and then like it can call a 100 at the same time five minutes later you have 100 quotes or 20 so [Music] yeah I think uh I mean it's only a matter of time by by the way before operator adds voice anyways you won't have to stitch it together with other voice agents totally all right here we go I need to fill out a contact form with your details okay so Chris Corner Chris coof founders.com just saying it out loud for the audio listeners all right you can see it's typing it in and I can take control at any time and go ahead yeah go I was going to say like do you often take control I feel like you're like why would you take control great question so with the Beehive example that I gave um I didn't really know how to explain it and I didn't know if it could like learn from what I did so I just I I gave it the prompt it logged into beehive and then it paused for whatever reason and I said I think I asked it I'm like can I just show you what to do and it's like yeah show me what to do so I took control and I just clicked on like newsletters clicked on the newsletter Integrations polls scroll down it was like do that so I think you can just like show it like it's Loom it's crazy and look at this look at the prompt look at the message we're looking for a menu that include stake in two sides could you please provide a perad quote thank you like it added all the punctuation it's proper number of guests 0 to 100 and if you wanted let's say you know make it you know change the tone for example mhm could you do something like that yes let's try it let's see if it'll let me tell it to not ask before submitting the form change the tone to be over the-top friendly don't ask before submitting the form okay so it's choosing a tentative wedding date for me did I even give it a date I don't think so no I didn't give it any dates so that's kind of interesting I guess Greg I'm happy to announce I'm getting married on May 11th I should probably tell my wife but that's what AI thinks so it did it it put in May 11th for whatever reason well I think it was smart right because you had to put something in yeah and you told them you told the operator to to do this so it's it just goes to show you how smart it is it's just interesting that it's asking me if I want it to submit but it's not asking me a date so I just asked it why it chose May 11th maybe he'll tell me uh gets a few months away allowing enough time for plan huh I'm gonna tell it to move faster see if it'll work say we're on YouTube move faster so it didn't it didn't respond to me when I told it to be over-the-top friendly or to not ask before submitting the form it's filling out this contact form and by the way this could could this be running 247 I I would imagine imagine that you'd get timed out at some point um you I'm sure you could use a third party like a clicking software where anytime this pops up just click the black button um but it just Greg it just submitted it for me and it didn't ask it's asked every time and all I had to do is ask it not to ask and it submitted it but you know what I didn't see the uh I didn't see if it used an over- the toop friendly phone uh tone it looks about the same m let's say yes use a very rude tone because it was already friendly so maybe it's you know totally and I really feel like it's working faster don't you yeah it is which is like an insane tip like that that works move faster move faster maybe hey maybe that's all deep seek is doing that's just the The Prompt move faster copy everything chat GPT scraped and move faster than it that's it $5 million um it doesn't look like it changed the prompt but it's moving really fast now this is crazy I'm gonna have all kinds of emails from these Caterers for sure I mean and you could also have it do research for you right it's like hey I want you to find um vegan caters only in Dallas County um like the more you're prompt the more you prompted to do the more you save time I'm gonna ask why the tone isn't [Laughter] rude well okay so it says checking offerings for tasteful yours catering when when it's okay when it says thinking if you click that what happens just okay got it it just says waiting filling vendor message for catering cro clicking scrolling and it didn't answer my question let's see this I want you to submit three quote request per minute wow that's smart if that works let's see so that's okay so that's a trick that I think you know not a trick a good way to get an agent to do what you want is to give it a goal that's with a certain goal like number goal I'm unable to submit quote requests at that speed however I'll continue to find more caterers so it went faster but not specifically faster I'm I'm unable to use a rude tone Oh how about this how about this then speak in Spanish have you tried that I'm unable to switch languages at the moment so I wonder if operator I mean can operator work in multiple languages I'm pretty sure it could make sure my request is over 300 words okay sometimes it was doing this yesterday like it gets to this like stubborn point where it's like it just says no to everything right like leave me alone I think what's happening is like once it's in the flow it's like don't talk to me right that's a good point it's acting like a like a 10x developer that's just like in a basement with his hoodie on yeah well should I keep prompting it to do more of this or should I move to my my third example let's go to your third example and then we'll we'll we'll wrap up the Pod okay I'm G save this okay so I'm going to tell it go to Oli Express and find trending items on the homepage and message 10 vendors of one of those items asking for a free sample to be shipped to Texas because I've I've done sourcing from China for 15 years and when we're looking for new products or new vendors we literally just take a message we copy and paste it to a 100 vendors on AliExpress or Alibaba and then we order samples for free and just imagine if you could go to sleep wake up with you know tracking numbers to 30 samples oh look at this it says the site's unaccessible I wonder why maybe it's a maybe it's a China thing that would be crazy it would be what did we just uncover yeah seriously or it's like yeah it's like open AI doesn't want to go to any Chinese sites anymore I wouldn't blame them um so it says attempting new tab for success I gave it a the exact URL and it's not working wow that's crazy let me see if it's working just like yeah on the web AliExpress yeah working fine so I told it to find a comparable site um and it is interesting Greg I've noticed like you would think that it would like draw on the llm more but it's it's just like Google stuff it like I don't know if it'll do it now but yesterday it was saying like yeah look alternatives to AliExpress like surely that's in your database you've got to Google it right now well the best part is it's not even Googling it it's using Bing yeah I know how embarrassing but it's on some generic AI generator website that says 11 best AliExpress alternatives and it's clicking on the first one that is crazy this is like my first look into what like AGI will look like say say more about that it's just it's one thing to hear what Sam mman says about how close we are to AGI and to you know read articles but then to see it just kind of go Rogue like just start googling things figuring stuff out click this go back click that like it's it's kind of breaking my frame okay so it's it's it's looking at trending uh products it's at banggood.com surely another Chinese site right I mean look at this the banner on the top advertises the Chinese New Year shipping DeLay So um it's like figuring out how to message them okay let's see what it says it found it ask a question pop up I want to order some of your earbuds would it be possible to receive a free sample ship to Texas thank you okay so it said I found the trending item the blitz wolf yada y yada earbuds and drafted a message requesting a free sample should I go ahead and send the message to the vendor and I I like how this website has a box that says check if you want the seller to respond so I said yes and check the box first it did and it's submitting and now it's telling me to create an account now should we see if it will create an account for me yeah let's have some fun I wonder if it'll generate like a strong password for me um here's my email Chris at co-founders I told it to generate a 20 character password oh my gosh it's doing it now that's freaky that's freaky this thing could go around all over the Internet and sign me up for all kinds of crap can and [Laughter] will it's exceeded the registration limit what let's try this I mean what do you think this is going to be doing in a month I think it's going to be moving faster and I think there's going to you know I think whoa I feel I feel like the what's mind betting to me right now is a lot of people are going to are watching this and are going to be like it's so slow oh it didn't go to AliExpress oh like pointing out all the faults it's literally a robot that is surfing the internet and doing things for you I think this is one of the greatest Arbitrage moments in business that we've ever seen you have S billion people connected to the internet you billions of people logging in Daily they've got credit cards attached to the these computers and now all of a sudden you have all you have you know chat GPT open AI all of the world's knowledge connected to this and then you have Bots that can go and do tasks for you based on outcomes and you're telling me that it cost $200 a month and people think that's expensive yeah I know oh I know and I got the four-digit code and I gave it to it and it's kind of stripping up here and dude I got a um I got an email back from a caterer it's a CN catering um by the way CN catering is probably like opening their inbox and being like Oh my God Chris wants to you know we got such you know Chris is a huge lead we we want we can't wait this a huge deal for us do they know oh okay so I'm going to take control and type in this code what was the code let me see 2149 and if we had more time by the way I feel like we could have figured that out yeah like we could have prompted our way to to get them to figure it out but we're trying to we're trying to keep it optimized for for you all all right so now we're logged in I now have an uh an account at bang good uh.com so I'm telling it to keep going you think $200 a month is overpriced or underpriced I think it's overpriced if you don't know what you're doing like if you don't like really like any software right you got to invest time into it and I think that's the hard part with 99% of people is they don't yet have ideas which is why they're watching this of how to use it but one a lot of the comments on my tweet were like oh my gosh I can use it for this I can it for that we're just we're just early I also think that a lot of people are probably waiting they're going to be like Oh I'm just going to wait till it gets better but the time is now so that once it's better like you really understand the nuances yep well that goes on we're going to go to my email CN catering sent you a message we do have your date available here are some sample menus so you can see some different options I'm sure thanks gladus I'm sure I could have the operator go in there and like compare my menu prices against whatever I want of course so it's still trying to look at okay here's like the log look at how hard it's working to find this a place to message which this is just like Chinese user interface 101 here like I'm not surprised I can't even find this crap you would be doing the same thing I would all right there's the same form we just had have an account first it's typing will it check the box it checked the Box submit now here's the question before in the look there it is in the old task it would ask me every time before submitting and then I said stop asking me and this is an entirely new task but I wonder if it remembered that and look it took a screenshot you see that wow it like took a screenshot of what it did could you have could you have it so that it's like put the screenshot in a Google doc or something like that so you have it on record let's ask and do it fast what have you learned in terms of prompting like what kind of best practices can you give to people well let's I mean to my point that it's acting like a human I'm probably going to treat it like a human that is not a human like I don't like treating humans rudely I don't try to be that type of manager but when it comes to this I will I'm going to be very blunt and direct and just keep commanding it to do what I want and like the only way you'll learn how to do it is by just telling it to do a thousand different things and making note of what works and what doesn't I mean it's it's looking for more products we don't have time for but in the future it would be cool if what you can do is like give it a a data set where it's like here's the you know 20 Trends I care about with the Google with Google Trend data for example um and you're looking for you're looking for products in these trends go go through bang good go through AliExpress and only get free samples in that Trend data m I like that and I actually I thought about doing something different where it could cold email for me so I tried this yesterday and I said like scrape um from a Google search results a bunch of emails and send them mold email and it was like I can't scrape and cold Outreach and I said well if I provide you a spreadsheet of emails with a a message and the spreadsheet has a column for emails and first names and message can you C can you send cold emails and customize it by first name and it was like yeah I can do that um I mean culty Milling software costs you know 100 bucks a month there's half your your money back wait how does it send the emails though like it must you log in yeah you log into your Gmail account inside of its browser wow that's crazy crazy yeah and I don't know why it picked earbuds but maybe I'll ask it's like according yeah it's not bad according to Apple's S9 the earbud Market is poised for 4.2% cagr over the next 10 years that'd be cool the earbuds were chosen because they were prominently featured on the homepage and had high ratings indicating they were trending if you prefer a different P type of product please let me know oh well this is great dude all right so we saw the future we live in the future we live in the future and no one knows it but us and the people watching us amazing all right um this has been fun uh Chris where could people get to know you better TKO pod.com the ker office podcast we'll include that in the show notes for people to go and check out uh like always I'm in the comment section the YouTube comment section so uh post your thoughts and uh what can I say I would say you know get your hands dirty go play with play with some of this that's right all right see you later Chris thanks Craig [Music]
